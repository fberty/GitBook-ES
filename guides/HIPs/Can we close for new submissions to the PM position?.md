# Can we close for new submissions to the PM position?
We close for new submissions to the PM position on the 19th of May and move on to voting on candidates. If new submissions come in while the poll is up we will wait a week before moving on to voting. https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-product-manager/299/38
