Summary

Change image rules to explicitly forbid black & white or rotated. Also add a max file size and a minimum resolution. 

Abstract

Current rules are not clear among many aspects. 
Right now, black and white images are not allowed in the registry, but rules do not say so explicitly. Also, a few days ago, many profiles with 90-degrees rotated images were rejected from the registry. 
I believe most of us agree that those type of images shouldn't be allowed, but it's not fair that rules are not crystal clear among those topics. 
Also, images have a don't have a max file size or a min resolution declared in the policies.
My proposal here is the following:
Re-write the point 2) of the policies:
> 2. Front-facing Submitter Picture - Required
> - The picture **must** include the face of the submitter facing the camera and the
> facial features must be visible.
> **-The picture must be in color and not contain any face modifying filters.**
> **-The picture must be under 3MB and have a minimum resolution of 256px by 256px.**
> **-The picture must be in the right orientation for the face to be recognized. Image rotation is not allowed.**
> - Face should not be covered under heavy make-up, large piercings or
> masks hindering the visibility of facial features. Headcover not covering
> the internal region of the face is acceptable (For example, a hijab is
> acceptable for a submitter but a niqab is not).
> - It can include items worn daily (ex: headscarf, turban, wig, light makeup,
> etc) provided they do not violate the previous point. It cannot include
> special items worn only on special occasions that can, voluntarily or
> involuntarily, distract humans or algorithms from being able to detect
> identical faces.
