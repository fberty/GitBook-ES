## Simple Summary

The HIP clarifies that the UBI DAO will follow the rules of the POH DAO at the time of the proposal unless stated otherwise.

## Abstract

The UBI DAO rules are the same ones the POH DAO rules at the time of HIP-22 unless stated otherwise in HIP-22 or a UBI DAO proposal.

## Motivation

[HIP-22](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-binding-hip-22-creation-of-the-ubi-dao/881) created the UBI DAO. However the proposal is not specific about rules and parameters of the DAO except in the calculation of voting power. This lead to difference of interpretation of the rules of the DAO which could lead to disputes and stalling the execution of proposals (as people wouldn't want to take the risk to lose their deposit if the Kleros court were to rule against their interpretation of the rules of the new DAO).

When asked to clarify those rules, the board decided that it didn't wish to rule on it and asked to have an HIP clarifying the rules. 

This proposal clarifies that the UBI DAO starts with the same rules as the POH DAO at the time of its creation unless stated otherwise.
It's still possible for the UBI DAO to modify its own rules.

Current UIP or UIP phases are considered to have been passed if they would have passed with the clarified rules of this proposal.

## Specification

The UBI DAO rules are the sames the POH DAO rules at the time of HIP-22 unless stated otherwise in HIP-22 or a UBI DAO proposal. This applies to (non exhaustive list): Voting period, deposits on the governor app, challenge period, delegations and UIP process (working like the HIP process).
It is possible to change those rules via UIPs.

### Implementation

This proposal doesn't require any coding but simply clarifies the rules for execution of UBI DAO decisions.
