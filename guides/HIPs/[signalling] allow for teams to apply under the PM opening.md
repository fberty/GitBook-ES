# [signalling] allow for teams to apply under the PM opening
HIP-3 (https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-3-recruitment-of-workers-for-the-dao/174) specified that the DAO would hire 1 Product Manager and 1 Developer. 

However, 2 teams have already applied to the position, so there's currently a debate on the forum about whether those applications should be considered valid, given the original post specified a single individual and not a team. 

The question here is: if a team applies with a budget that does not preclude the ability to hire a developer (thus not being in contradiction with HIP-3) can this application be considered valid? 

Arguments for and against can be checked on the forum (https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-product-manager/299).
