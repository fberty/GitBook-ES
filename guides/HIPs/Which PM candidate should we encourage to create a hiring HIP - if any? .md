This poll is created to encourage one of the PM candidates to create a hiring proposal targeting themselves. Such a proposal would then follow the normal procedures of the PoH DAO. 

This poll is not a vote and is non-binding.

So, which candidate would you like to see create a proposal?
(Note that approval voting is being used so you can select several candidates. You can also choose to ask for more time before we take this step and at the same time give a preference for candidates, should the vote go against you).
