# Summary

Change image rules to explicitly forbid black & white or rotated. Also add a max file size and a minimum resolution.

# Abstract

Current rules are not clear among many aspects. Right now, black and white images are not allowed in the registry, but rules do not say so explicitly. Also, a few days ago, many profiles with 90-degrees rotated images were rejected from the registry. I believe most of us agree that those type of images shouldn't be allowed, but it's not fair that rules are not crystal clear among those topics. Also, images don't have a max file size or a min resolution declared in the policies.

# Implementation

Re-write the point 2) of the policies as follows:
> 2. Front-facing Submitter Picture - Required
>
>
>
> * The picture **must** include the face of the submitter facing the camera and the
> facial features must be visible.
> **-The picture must be in color and not contain any artificial modification to the facial features.**
> **-The picture must be under 3MB and have a minimum resolution of 256px by 256px.**
> **-The picture must be in the right orientation for the face to be recognized. Image rotation is not allowed.**
> * Face should not be covered under large piercings or masks hindering the visibility of facial features. 
> * Neutral, soft and natural make-up without colored lipstick, eyeliner or eyeshadows are acceptable. Any make-up product or item that significantly alters or modifies facial features is not allowed.
> * Headcover not covering the internal region of the face is acceptable (For example, a hijab is
> acceptable for a submitter but a niqab is not).
> * It can include items worn daily (ex: headscarf, turban, wig, etc) provided they do not violate the previous points. It cannot include
> special items worn only on special occasions that can, voluntarily or
> involuntarily, distract humans or algorithms from being able to detect identical faces.
