In it current state, HIP-16 acts as a barrier for admin changes.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOne of the points of HIP-16, specifically point 4 of *Elections*:\n\n> Elections are made using quadratic voting (negative votes are allowed)\n\nis not possible. Thus, this HIP-16 effectively removes any possibility of electing new admins, or kicking current admins, because the due process designed by it cannot be followed as it is specified.\n\nAlso, admin roles that were acquired before this HIP-16 did not go through the process, so the HIP-16 shields them from accountability, as they cannot be removed from their positions.\n\n## Rationale\n\nNullifying HIP-16 eliminates the legitimacy current PoH admin roles have over their positions, solving the issue described in *Motivation*.\n\n## Implementation\n\nAbolish HIP-16.",

        "title": "[Phase 2] HIP-49: Change of Arbitrator",
        "body": "```\nHIP: 49\ntitle: Change of Arbitrator\nauthors: MoniK, HBesso31.eth, pCorace.eth, nicobilinkis.eth, castorpolux.eth, Roberto Iquitos, Andres Vilches, Ruben Alejandro Puca Vilte, drlorente97.eth,  jfdominguez.eth, Pablo Buencrypto, ANM, Flor Velastiqui, Hernán DLF, lautaro.eth, juanipose.eth\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2022-07-05\n```\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to change the smart contract that deals with disputes to the profile submission and removals (a.k.a, the Arbitrator) with a new one that serves better the interests of the Proof of Humanity community.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe Proof of Humanity contract will change its arbitrator to a new deployment of a [Kleros Arbitrator](https://github.com/kleros/kleros) that will be an exact replica of the existing one but with one critical chage:\n\n* The Governor of the new contract will be set to the Proof of Humanity Governor address (`0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF`) so future changes around Proof of Humanity's dispute resolution court are set by its own community as well.\n\nThis new arbitrator will also be set on the Governor Contract (`0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF`) of Proof of Humanity, effectively putting any potential disputes that happen with it on the hands of the Proof of Humanity DAO.\n\nEverything else will remain exactly the same in order to guarantee compatibility with the road tested settings of past dispute resolutions. The tokenomics of the new Arbitrator will not be modified with neither UBI nor an alternative new token. **PNK will remain as the only staking token valid for this new arbitrator.** \n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Kleros Arbitration smart contracts that are being used by the Proof of Humanity protocol and the Proof of Humanity DAO are currently governed by the Kleros Coop where they are the only entity that can define its parameters moving forward. \n\nOur aim is to further decentralize the Proof of Humanity project by using the democratic processes put in place by the Proof of Humanity DAO. During the first year of our DAO, not a single election has been disputed with over 40 decisions being made by the DAO and the combination of Proof of Humanity with Snapshot has proven to be an efficient approach to democratic decision making. \n\nOur goal is to use this mechanism to decide over the Arbitrator being used by the Protocol and the DAO's Governor contract.\n\n\n### Specification\n\nAny potential dispute that emerges today either from the Proof of Humanity Governor or the Proof of Humanity DAO will go to an Arbitrator contract that ultimately has its parameters set by the Kleros Coop.\n\nA comparison between the vote distribution in the decision making process between the Proof of Humanity DAO and the Kleros Coop show very different distribution of power on each organization:\n\n![Proof of Humanity DAO](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/uploads/default/original/1X/e65fa8189d1f22457c13cbd8bfd22a10fd06ea66.jpeg)\n\n![Kleros Coop](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/uploads/default/original/1X/c3e9c0fe4800da1c99aa086bece58d04b610e43a.jpeg)\n\nAs much as we trust the knowledge and experience that Kleros has contributed to the Proof of Humanity project, by advancing with this change the Proof of Humanity community will be able to set the rules for its own Arbitration mechanisms and take an effective step towards greater decentralization.\n\n**No project ever begins decentralized. It's up to the community to take the necessary steps to guarantee progressive decentralization. With the approval of this proposal we are taking a critical step in that direction.**\n\nFor this purpose, we will deploy a new contract that follows the same exact settings the current Arbitrator has but with its Governor set to the Proof of Humanity Governor. And the Proof of Humanity Governor's Arbitrator will be set to the new Arbitrator being deployed.\n\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe incorporation of an Arbitrator dependent of the Proof of Humanity DAO would reduce the risk of the DAO being captured in a Governance Gridlock by actors that are not aligned with the core interests of Proof of Humanity. \n\nThis change will increase the robustness of the DAO, in accordance to a more mature decentralization since every verified human will have a right to vote over the parameters of the Arbitrator. \n\nAdditionally, we would be able to modify the Governor with the power of *1 person 1 vote*, giving the DAO sovereign control over its own Dispute resolution courts. \n\nDAO control over the arbitrator and its governor is key to emancipate Proof of Humanity as an autonomous organization free from centralized interests.\n\nWith autonomy over the design of the courts we can later add after careful Tokenomics research the possibility of limiting large concentrations of staking, and incentivizing the same principles of equal access to justice within our Registry. \n\nAnother advantage that we have over the Kleros Courts is that Humanity Court can better specify and regulate juror misconduct or exploitative behaviours in a faster, more efficient way.\n\nFuture implementations of Courts serving the Proof of Humanity protocol —whether its Kleros v2 or a new compatible Arbitator— can only be accepted if they also follow the configurations described on this HIP and thus maintain the Proof of Humanity Governor as the Arbitrator Governor. No other settings can be accepted in the case of a Court Update in the future. \n\n### Implementation\n\nAn exact replica of the existing Kleros arbitration contract will be deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. \n\nThe same version of `KlerosLiquid.sol` smart contract found on Proof of Humanity's current court available on `0x988b3A538b618C7A603e1c11Ab82Cd16dbE28069` will be used.\n\nThe new court will be deployed with the following settings in its `constructor` function:\n\n```\n// The governor of the contract will be set to the Proof of Humanity governor.\naddress _governor = 0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF\n\n// The pinakion token contract will keep using the PNK token.\nPinakion _pinakion = 0x93ed3fbe21207ec2e8f2d3c3de6e058cb73bc04d\n\n// The random number generator contract will keep using the existing RNG.\nRNG _RNGenerator = 0x1738B62E403090666687243e758b1C29eDfFc90e\n\n// The minimum staking time.\nuint _minStakingTime = 8700000000000000000000\n\n// The maximum drawing time.\nuint _maxDrawingTime = 7200\n\n// Whether to use commit and reveal or not.\nbool _hiddenVotes = false\n\n// Minimum tokens needed to stake in the court.\nuint _minStake = 8700000000000000000000\n\n// Basis point of tokens that are lost when incoherent.\nuint _alpha = 5000\n\n// Arbitration fee paid per juror.\nuint _feeForJuror = 25000000000000000\n\nuint _jurorsForCourtJump = 31\n\n// The time allotted to each dispute period in the form `timesPerPeriod[period]`.\nuint[4] _timesPerPeriod = [540000, 437400, 437400, 291600]\n\n// The number of children per node of the general court's sortition sum tree.\nuint _sortitionSumTreeK = 8\n\n```\n\nOnce this contract has been successfully deployed on mainnet, it will be set to have a Court with ID 1 that will work as the Humanity Court that will be linked to Proof of Humanity. \n\nThen the following tickets will be submitted to the Proof of Humanity Governor:\n\n- *HIP 49 Change the Arbitrator of the Proof of Humanity Protocol*: The Proof of Humanity protocol (`0xC5E9dDebb09Cd64DfaCab4011A0D5cEDaf7c9BDb`) will execute `changeArbitrator` with the paremeter `address _arbitrator` set with the new arbitrator contract and the extra bytes data necessary to connect it to the Humanity Court with Court Id 1. \n- *HIP 49 Change the Arbitrator of the Proof of Humanity Governor*: The Proof of Humanity Governor (`0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF`) will execute `changeArbitrator` with the paremeter `address _arbitrator` set with the new arbitrator contract and the extra bytes data necessary to connect it to the Humanity Court with the Court Id 1. \n\nOnce these changes are in place, the Proof of Humanity DAO will effectively control the rules of its own Arbitrator and disputes on the Governor will be setlled by the Proof of Humanity Arbitrator contract.

        "title": "[Phase 3] [Binding] HIP 45: PDF → Markdown",
        "body": "```\nHIP: 45\ntitle: Rewrite Policy in Markdown instead of PDF\nauthor: @greenlucid\nstatus: Phase 3\ncreated: 2022-06-23\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nMigrate the policy from PDF to Markdown, and edit the policy in a repository.\n\n## Abstract\n\nPolicies should be written and edited in Markdown. This makes coordination easier and, in particular, speeds up policy editions, even more so when dealing with concurrent HIPs. A repository will be built under [Proof of Humanity GitHub](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/) for this purpose.\n\n## Motivation\n\nUsing pdf as the raw document for a policy is a coordination disaster. There is too much friction around making changes to the policy to integrate the HIPs that affect it. With a PDF, the latest working document must also be made available, which introduces delays. Also, to make this new quality of life explicit, a repository will be used to coordinate the changes.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe format should be easy to edit, audit, and replicate. The format should make it easy to follow changes and notice mistakes, just like code repositories do. Code repositories are the state of the art solution to coordinate changes across technical files (*source code*), so it makes sense to also use a repository for a critical document such as the PoH registration policy.\n\nThe official [Proof of Humanity GitHub](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/) was chosen as a default option, but this HIP does not mandate it must be the only repository to use. Although, it is recommended to contribute all changes in the same repository, for clarity.\n\n## Implementation\n\nMake a repository for the express purpose of containing this policy, or other important files (such as the `MetaEvidence` jsons). This rewrite of the policy will be the starting basis for the repository:\n\n[poh-policy.md ](https://github.com/greenlucid/poh-policy/blob/master/poh-policy.md) (feel free to make PRs to fix issues during this Phase 2)\n[Rendered sample ](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmTbxCZQL28w6TFgJ6XBPqmBuw2eeNtR9T5u3tYJgEJhLt/Proof%20of%20Humanity%20Registry%20Policy.pdf) (this render is not particularly good)\n\nThe process to edit and champion HIPs that modify the policy should be the following:\n\n* The champion of the HIP forks the repository containing the policy.\n* The champion creates a draft Pull Request to the base repository with the name of the HIP and a link to the HIP in the description.\n* The champion writes the changes to the policy, and asks for reviews and feedback. This can be done during Phase 1 or Phase 2.\n* After the feedback process, the PR stops being a Draft and no further changes are allowed. The HIP then gets to Phase 3.\n* If the HIP passes, the PR is merged.\n\nWhen this HIP is merged, the Markdown document that was specified above, will be provided as it is, without rendering, as a plain Markdown file, on the MetaEvidence.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Who are “the reviewers”?\n\nThis is purposely under-specified. It could just be voluntaries or enthusiasts, but there’s no explicit need for them to be authority figures, or Mission Board members. My suggestion is that a few eyes that don’t agree with the HIP should also take a look.\n\n### Isn’t this complicated for non-technical contributors?\n\nIt’s certainly not harder than what we currently have. But, if this was the case, I will write a short guide on how to join a repository and follow the steps for non-technical people to champion or contribute to HIPs.\n\n### Won’t it be ugly for the users to show a raw text file?\nIt is possible to use a browser extension to render markdown dynamically. [This is such an example ](https://github.com/KeithLRobertson/markdown-viewer).\n\nAs a previous step to this Phase 3, a [signaling vote was made](https://snapshot.org/#/proofofhumanity.eth/proposal/0x927babd661f1706b3b16af8991daec63be52bd4b87e1f4ab3a8206fa8f9ecd1b) to decide whether if the Policy should be published as Markdown or PDF. The voters decided to continue with the Policy being published as a Markdown file in the MetaEvidence.  Some discussion of pros and cons was made on the topic. This is not final: if the Phase 3 rejects this migration, this whole process could take place again to decide if the Policy should be Markdown of a PDF render.\n\n### Where is the markdown policy kept?\n\nIt doesn’t matter if it’s published as a raw markdown or published as pdf, it should be kept in a repository in any case, to allow following the process indicated in the *implementation* header.\nAs for the specific question of, in which repository, I would suggest to use the [official Proof of Humanity GitHub repository ](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/).\n",

        "body": "```\nHIP: 48\ntitle: Removal of Clement Lesaege as mission board member\nauthor: ludoviko.ETH \nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2022-01-06\n```\n\n### Simple Summary\nThis HIP proposes the removal of Clement Leseage from the mission board and the snapshot admin. \n\n### Abstract\nGiven the latest events regarding the actions of Clement as an admin for the Snapshot polls, and the overall attitude of constantly delaying any advancement or progress of any proposals that obstructs his own agenda, I am proposing the removal of Clement Lesaege from the mission board, based on the premise that he is not aligned with the values of Democratization and Decentralization and respect for privacy of individuals being registered in the DAO. \n\n### Motivation\n* Obstructing normal governance procedures. There is a recent incident in which the proposers for HIPs on Snapshot was unilaterally deleted, against the advice from the other admin of the platform Santi Siri, because it was being done without proper consultation with the DAO. \n* This later issue, along with the creation of HIP-34 itself (which dramatically decreases open participation for proposals), created a situation that now requires two different and new HIPs to solve the issue.\n* An unsuccessful attempt to remove a valid admin from the Telegram group (for the record, I was the admin asked to be removed). \n* Disregarding serious security threats to the registering process ([metadata issue](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/proof-of-humanity-web/issues/295#event-4798667830)): When warned about this issue, Clement lowered the priority of a huge security threat in which personal georeferencing data was being leaked into the registry profiles. In a forum post he mentioned that having personal data leaked was [\"a nice thing to have\"](https://t.me/proofhumanity/28352)\n* Systematically obstaculizing any process that helps humans register (352, vouchallengers, etc) sometimes suggesting that challenges are good and vouch-and-challenge attacks are part of the normal mechanism:\n    * Example 1, stating against better explanation of proper vouching https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/incentivize-better-more-responsible-vouching/144/2\n    * Example 2, stating that the only way to keep deposits low is keeping the challenges high https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/challenges-and-removals-its-always-fair/251/10\n    * Example 3, falsely accusing of being \"undemocratic\" a democratic poll https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-product-manager/299/68 and this is **critical for someone holding veto power in snapshot**.\n    * Example 4, saying that it is [\"perfectly fine\"](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-12-let-users-decide-to-accept-vouches-when-your-profile-is-in-vouching-phase/583/5) and having the opportunity to withdraw from a mistake is [a \"courtesy\" and not a right](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-12-let-users-decide-to-accept-vouches-when-your-profile-is-in-vouching-phase/583/6).     \n* Following the previous point, making Proof of Humanity a dispute-creating machine. \n* Sabotaging or lack of respect to proper procedure\n    * [Arguing about voter fatigue in proposals](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/search?q=voter%20fatigue%20%40clesaege) that he disagreed with, creating voter fatigue in [proposal cloning](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-18-communication-roles/816) in order to match his own individual standards. \n* Under-specifying regulations so that he can later interpret the normative as he unilaterally thinks (basically all the hips he authored, including HIP-34)\n* Lack of proper spirit of collaboration with the community, evidenced by lack of participation in main groups.\n* Stalling the hiring process to the point that the actuall hiring was put in hibernation https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-product-manager/299. \n    * It is worth also noting the contradiction with other comments in which he stated that hiring should be done fast https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-developer/300/5 \n* Taking decisions in the background without proper consultation to DAO members, or disregarding alternative perspectives. \n* Not acknowledging the issues regarding the concentration and dominance of a priviledge few in the Kleros Humanity Court and not doing anything to prevent such an abnormal degree of centralization.\n\n# Rationale\nThis HIP was left on hold since its creation, but recent events regarding removal of dissenting members of the DAO from telegram channels have sparked the interest of the community to move forward with this proposal. \n\n# Implementation\nIf Phase 3 binding vote is approved, the position that Clement Lesaege is occupying as a Mission Board Member will become vacant. (for Phase 3 it could be debated if he can re-apply for the position in the next term).",

        "title": "[Phase-2] [Signalling] HIP-45: Rewrite Policy in Markdown instead of PDF",
        "body": "```\nHIP: 45\ntitle: Rewrite Policy in Markdown instead of PDF\nauthor: @greenlucid\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2022-06-23\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nMigrate the policy from PDF to Markdown, and edit the policy in a repository.\n\n## Abstract\n\nPolicies should be written and edited in Markdown. This makes coordination easier and, in particular, speeds up policy editions, even more so when dealing with concurrent HIPs. A repository will be built under [Proof of Humanity GitHub](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/) for this purpose. \n\n## Motivation\n\nUsing pdf as the raw document for a policy is a coordination disaster. There is too much friction around making changes to the policy to integrate the HIPs that affect it. With a PDF, the latest working document must also be made available, which introduces delays. Also, to make this new quality of life explicit, a repository will be used to coordinate the changes. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThe format should be easy to edit, audit, and replicate. The format should make it easy to follow changes and notice mistakes, just like code repositories do. Code repositories are the state of the art solution to coordinate changes across technical files (*source code*), so it makes sense to also use a repository for a critical document such as the PoH registration policy.\n\nThe official [Proof of Humanity GitHub](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/) was chosen as a default option, but this HIP does not mandate it must be the only repository to use. Although, it is recommended to contribute all changes in the same repository, for clarity.\n\n## Implementation\n\nMake a repository for the express purpose of containing this policy, or other important files (such as the `MetaEvidence` jsons). This rewrite of the policy will be the starting basis for the repository:\n\n[poh-policy.md](https://github.com/greenlucid/poh-policy/blob/master/poh-policy.md) (feel free to make PRs to fix issues during this Phase 2)\n[Rendered sample](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmTbxCZQL28w6TFgJ6XBPqmBuw2eeNtR9T5u3tYJgEJhLt/Proof%20of%20Humanity%20Registry%20Policy.pdf) (this render is not particularly good)\n\nThe process to edit and champion HIPs that modify the policy should be the following:\n\n* The champion of the HIP forks the repository containing the policy.\n* The champion creates a draft Pull Request to the base repository with the name of the HIP and a link to the HIP in the description.\n* The champion writes the changes to the policy, and asks for reviews and feedback. This can be done during Phase 1 or Phase 2.\n* After the feedback process, the PR stops being a Draft and no further changes are allowed. The HIP then gets to Phase 3.\n* If the HIP passes, the PR is merged.\n\n---\n\n## Addendum - FAQ\n\n### Who are “the reviewers”?\n\nThis is purposely under-specified. It could just be voluntaries or enthusiasts, but there’s no explicit need for them to be authority figures, or Mission Board members. My suggestion is that a few eyes that don’t agree with the HIP should also take a look.\n\n### Isn’t this complicated for non-technical contributors?\n\nIt’s certainly not harder than what we currently have. But, if this was the case, I will write a short guide on how to join a repository and follow the steps for non-technical people to champion or contribute to HIPs.\n\n### Won’t it be ugly for the users to show a raw text file?\n\nThis HIP does not set into stone that the raw markdown file must be the policy provided in the `MetaEvidence`. But, it is possible to use a browser extension to render markdown dynamically. [This is such an example](https://github.com/KeithLRobertson/markdown-viewer).\n\nIt is also possible to use an app such as [md2pdf](https://md2pdf.netlify.app/) to render the markdown as a pdf file, and then include that file in the `MetaEvidence`. But this creates an extra step that should be scrutinized.\n\n### Where is the markdown policy kept?\n\nIt doesn’t matter if it’s published as a raw markdown or published as pdf, it should be kept in a repository in any case, to allow following the process indicated in the *implementation* header.\nAs for the specific question of, in which repository, I would suggest to use the [official Proof of Humanity GitHub repository ](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/).",

        "body": "># HIP 42 \n>## Allow Spanish Phrase/ Permitir Frase en Castellano/Español\n> **Authors: Lety (Laura Leticia Lopez), nicobilinkis.eth**\n>  status:  Fase 3 \n> _Created: 2022/05/30_\n> [Gov forum discussion](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-binding-hip-42-allow-spanish-phrase/2096)\n\n## Abstract / Resumen \n\nPoH registrants, or those who renew their registration, will be allowed to say the phrase that is required to register in Spanish at the time of recording their video. Those who choose to do it in Spanish will not need to record a video in English. All subsequent validation that is required must be in Spanish if it was the language utilized in the video.\n## Motivation / Motivación\n\n- Proof of Humanity and the Universal Basic Income emphasizes that income should be a right that is universal for all people disregarding their origin or status. This universality concept could be expanded to the other aspects of the platform. Although being a de facto language spoken in large parts of developed societies and persons that have access and resources to afford quality language education, English is not the language with the most native speakers. Users should have an alternative option to English. This would solve the current limitation of not including peoples native languages and it would remove this need.\n\nA total of 580 million people speak Spanish worldwide, 7.6% of the world's population. Of these, 483 million - three million more than a year ago - are native Spanish speakers, making Spanish the second most spoken mother tongue in the world by number of speakers (Source: www.cervantes.es).\n\nRight now the Spanish PoH community is not only very agile but has a larger number of active humans on their networks than the English community. We believe that giving it the space it deserves is important to expand, even more, the growth of our PoH community. In the week of May 22-29, 2022, while the first vote was held to elect the new Mission Board Members, the Proof of Humanity Spanish Telegram group had 79% of the total activity of the groups, while 19% was occupied by the English group, and the rest by the Italian, German, Catalan and Russian speaking groups. It is also important to mention that of the eight applicants, five are native Spanish speakers.\n\nWe consider that community activity is highly important as self-regulation, which implies that there are people within the Spanish-speaking community who are trained and currently making challenge requests to keep the registry curated.  \n\n- We also believe it is essential that registrants know exactly what they are saying when they are registering, and in this way prevent pronunciation errors of native Spanish speakers. \n\n- On the other hand, and from a more philosophical aspect, which again focuses on what it means to cover needs, we can also understand that the adoption of the languages of active communities has to do with covering all aspects of the pyramid of human needs proposed in the psychological theory of Abraham Maslow, and also to put into practice what the detractors of this theory claim, which is the theory of Human Scale Development, in which Max-Neef, Elizalde and Hopenhayn proposed a radical change in the way of understanding development, which at that time was assimilated with economic growth, as opposed to this vision, they proposed a development based on a human scale.\nIn the face of this vision, they proposed a development based on people and the improvement of their quality of life. Understanding the complexity of these theories and seeking a balance between them would turn the entire Proof of Humanity community into an overcoming instance, combining the aspects of both theories since they are taken into account from the very foundations of the project (which are the ones we are building every time we make a Hip that allows us to improve and expand the protocol) that allows us to, We hope that this will be replicated, generating active participation and better opportunities for access to the registry without losing sight of its curation, which implies, precisely, a very active participation of the native speakers of each language that is incorporated.\n\n- At the moment the comparison of records using voice biometric data is not used within Proof of Humanity, however, we know that it is possible that it will be applied in the future. Therefore, and in response to the request for security reinforcement requested by people in the community, we investigated the following: the development of the open source algorithms that exist so far still confuse similar voices in the same language (in the case of the algorithms that unlock the cell phones we use every day there is, in fact, a warning explaining that anyone with a voice frequency similar to ours can unlock our device if we use only that security measure). However they are able to recognize similar voice frequencies in different languages without problems: we can test it by speaking to our device in other languages. Private voice recognition algorithms, which are already being used in some banks (such as BBVA with company Veridas. Source: https://veridas.com/autenticacion-con-voz/) as an additional security measure, can isolate unique frequencies to be used for personal identification, and is performed independently of text and language. To summarize the point: in case it is necessary to use this technology in the future, we will surely be able to access or develop, which would be even more interesting, as a community, a recognition algorithm that isolates the frequency of the voice in search of uniqueness without text or language requirements, so it is not an impediment today or in the future that each person uses his native language to make the video that requires registration. \n- We also know that there are many followers of the phrase \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\", popularized in English by Bert Lance, an American civil servant, during Jimmy Carter's administration. The underlying belief in that phrase was that when things work \"right\" they don't need money or effort to be changed. But that was in the past. Right now, unless your business is a monopoly, an oligopoly or you want your business to live in the past - for a short period of time, for sure - you are not expected to change. So change is something you have to believe in, embrace it and make it happen. What you do well now, you can certainly do better and improve. And this applies to technology in Web3, you expect the process and your experience to work, from start to the end, and you look for much more every day, among those things, recognition of what each community brings to the table. The lower the friction in an interaction, the greater the chances that the experience will be better. This is what Business Transformation of a new decentralized on-chain era is all about, waking up and fixing what is not yet broken.\n\n## Implementation / Implementación \n \nThe primary document must be modified adding the following paragraph:  \n \n“Only native spanish speakers should say the phrase: \"Certifico que soy una persona humana real y que no estoy actualmente en este registro\". If other words or extra validation phrases are required, they must be said in Spanish as well. Casual omission of words of the phrase, or accents are not grounds for removals or challenges and rejections. Mispronunciations of the words in that phrase are. Submitters should speak in their normal voice and should not attempt mimicking someone else’s voice. Speaking before or after the required sentence is acceptable.” \n\n## Specification / Especificación\n\nNative Spanish speakers who choose to make the video in Spanish may do so by saying the phrase: **\"Certifico que soy una persona humana real y que no estoy actualmente en este registro\".** (It is the direct, non gendered, translation of the current phrase)\nIf other words or extra validation phrases are required or used, they should also be pronounced in Spanish.\nHumans who are not native Spanish speakers should choose the English language, not Spanish, because it's not going to be allowed mispronunciation. Clarification: That is the reason why the Spanish phrase is only recommended for native speakers, it will not be anyone's task to determine whether or not the people are native speakers but that the requested phrase is pronounced without any mispronuntiations.\n## Rationale / Justificación\n\nThis Hip was made to meet the constant request of the Spanish Speakers community that requested on countless occasions that the registration could be in their native language (the first request in the community telegram group dates back to March 2021). \nThe reason why this particular phrase in Spanish was chosen (i.e. choosing “I am a real human person” instead of “I am a real human being”) is because words in Spanish are gendered, which is why it cannot be translated directly since there could be people within the community who do not feel comfortable with a binary expression. We believe that such a phrase would therefore be appropriate.\n\n## Special Thanks / Agradecimientos Especiales\n\nIn the first place we want to thank all the Proof of Humanity Telegram Community in Spanish, since this idea came from there and we´re just capturing it here.\nAnd a Special Thanks to the admins and collaborators that support us every day in this great community! \nAnd at last but least to **Ludoviko.eth, Mathaius.eth, V4len.eth, @MoniK74, @Onediss and Lufo** for their invaluable contribution.\n\n",

        "title": "[Phase 3] [Binding] HIP-41: Allow verbal confirmation for registrating users",
        "body": ">HIP 41\n>Title: Allow verbal confirmation for registrating users\n>authors: avsa.eth and nicobilinkis.eth\n>Status: Phase 3\n>Created: 2022-28-3\n\n[Gov forum post](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-binding-hip-41-allow-verbal-confirmation-for-registrating-users/1975)\n\n# Simple Summary\nThis would add the option to have a user, instead of holding a sign with their address, give a verbal confirmation of their public address. Either visual or verbal confirmation would be accepted.\n\n\n# Abstract\nThe user, when onboarding, should be able to decide either to make a visual or verbal confirmation (or both) of their public address during their video. \n\nThe current rules for profile submission require a mandatory sign (can be a screen) showing the full Ethereum address. This has been a point of failure for many people. Although many efforts where made to help resolve those problems, such as HIP-27 allowing for one character mistakes, the sign itself is just one more step to fight deep-fakes. \nConsidering all those facts, we believe that it's feasible to replace that sign with a verbal confirmation. Instead of showing a sign with the ETH address the submitter would have to say out loud **8 words** that confirm ownership of both address and media files.\n\n# Motivation\nThe advantages are clear:\n\n* Easier flow, as the user can do all the process in one take in the video by following simple instructions on screen\n* No props needed: Human doesn’t need to fish around to get a pen and a paper or find a second screen, nor spend a long time trying to slowly copy the address.\n* More accessible: For people with movement or vision impairment, this would make it easier for them to be included in the system\n* DOESN’T EXCLUDE SIGNS: users who still prefer to hold signs (maybe someone who is speech impaired, or just shy) can still use visual confirmation of their address.\n\n# Implementation\n\n## Changes to the primary document\nModify section 4 of the primary document to the following:\n> 4. Video of the submitter - Required\n> * **The user can choose to display his Ethereum address using a physical sign. \nThe sign has to display in a readable manner the full Ethereum address of the\nsubmitter (No ENS; no ellipsis). The sign can be a screen. The submitter must\nshow the sign in the right orientation to be read on the video.**\n    A single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n    - omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” →\n    “abd”).\n    - mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the\n    one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”).\n    - swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have\n    been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”).\n    - additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere\n    in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”).\n\n> * **The user can choose to use verbal confirmation. The user has to say the 8 words that are shown on the screen when recording their video. These words are the result of turning the submitter's Ethereum address into base 2048 and then matching these with the BIP-039 dictionary of the same language that the user is using for the rest of the phrase. Word omission or order swapping are not allowed. Poor accents or mispronunciations are not grounds for rejections. The verbal confirmation must be said in the same language as the rest of the phrase.**\n> * The submitter must say « I certify that I am a real human and that I am not\nalready registered in this registry ». Submitters should speak in their normal voice\nand should not attempt mimicking someone else’s voice. Speaking before or after\nthe required sentence is acceptable. Poor English accents, mispronunciations,\nand the switch or oversight of words in that sentence are not grounds for\nrejections.\n> * Video submissions must follow all of the following requirements:\n    * at most 2 minutes long,\n    * in the video/webm, video/MP4, video/avi or video/mov format,\n    * vertical (portrait), horizontal (landscape) or square,\n    and follow these minimum size requirements:\n    * Minimum height: equal to or higher than 352 pixels\n    * Minimum width: equal to or higher than 352 pixels\n> * Lighting conditions and recording device quality should be sufficient to discern\nfacial features and characters composing the Ethereum address displayed.\n> * The quality of the audio should be high enough such that the speaker can be\nunderstood clearly. Small background noises are acceptable as long as they\ndon’t prevent a clear understanding of the speaker.\n> * The face of the submitter should follow the requirements of section 2\n\n\n\n\n\n**BIP-039 words**\n\nThe user must look at the camera and say (in one of the officially accepted languages): \n\"I certify that I am a real human and that I am not already registered in this registry. My confirmation phrase is \"\n\nFollowing by an identifier which is obtained by converting the hexadecimal Ethereum address into base 2048, then converting those digits into [the official BIP-039 dictionary words](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md). The user then must speak the **first 8 resulting words**.\n\nThe BIP039 dictionary **MUST** be in the same language as the rest of the phrase, so when a future HIP approves a new language, this HIP will not need to be updated. If a future HIP approves a new official Proof of Humanity language that does not have an official BIP039 dictionary yet, then the HIP that adds the new language must also define an official word dictionary for the purposes of this HIP.\n> \n> Example:\n> The address **0x17a91203a9e9c3519c2f76210497ef7f4be2352f**\n> Would be spoken as: **absent, tumble, catch, dentist, visual, ask, crime, control.** (commas and spacing are optional)\n\nThe phrase derived from the address would be generated **automatically** in the **DAPP UI**. Also it would be shown on every profile that chose this verification method, so that validators can still curate the list as usual. Both options can be seen in the Demo below. \n\n## Demo\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/swnEfg5.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b4LN7DZ.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": ">HIP 41\n>Title: Allow verbal confirmation for registrating users\n>authors: avsa.eth and nicobilinkis.eth\n>Status: Phase 2\n>Created: 2022-28-3\n>URL:https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-41-allow-verbal-confirmation-for-registrating-users/1888\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis would add the option to have a user, instead of holding a sign with their address, give a verbal confirmation of their public address. Either visual or verbal confirmation would be accepted.\n\n## Abstract\n\n\nThe user, when onboarding, should be able to decide either to make a visual or verbal confirmation (or both) of their public address during their video. \n\nThe current rules for profile submission require a mandatory sign (can be a screen) showing the full Ethereum address. This has been a point of failure for many people. Although many efforts where made to help resolve those problems, such as HIP-27 allowing for one character mistakes, the sign itself is just one more step to fight deep-fakes. Considering all those facts, we believe that it's feasible to replace that sign with a verbal confirmation. Instead of showing a sign with the ETH address the submitter would have to say out loud a series of words that confirm ownership of both address and media files.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe advantages are clear:\n\nEasier flow, as the user can do all the process in one take in the video by following simple instructions on screen\nNo props needed. Human doesn’t need to fish around to get a pen and a paper or find a second screen, nor spend a long time trying to slowly copy the address.\nMore accessible. For people with movement or vision impairment, this would make it easier for them to be included in the system\nDOESN’T EXCLUDE SIGNS: users who still prefer to hold signs (maybe someone who is speech impaired, or just shy) can still use visual confirmation of their address.\n\n## Implementation\n\n\n**BIP 039 words**\n\nThe user must look at the camera and say (in one of the officially acepted languages): \n\"I certify that I am a real human and that I am not already in this registry. My identifier is \"\n\nFollowing by an identifier which is obtained by converting the hexadecimal ethereum address into base 2048, then converting those digits into [the official BIP039 dictionary words](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md). The user then must speak the **first 6 resulting words in the same same language as the phrase**.\n> \n> Example:\n> The address **0x17a91203a9e9c3519c2f76210497ef7f4be2352f**\n> Would be spoken as: **Able Barrel, Debris Siege, Pretty Inquiry.** (commas and spacing are optional)\n\nThe phrase derived from the address would be generated **automatically** in the **DAPP UI**. Also it would be shown on every profile that chose this verification method, so that validators can still curate the list as usual. \n\nThe BIP039 dictionary **MUST** be in the same language as the rest of the phrase, so when a future HIP approves a new language, this HIP will not need to be updated. If a future HIP approves a new official Proof of Humanity language that does not have an official BIP039 dictionary yet, then the HIP that adds the new language must also define an official word dictionary for the purposes of this HIP.\n",

A poll made on Snapshot was used to gather a list of addresses of people interested in having that role.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOriginal and deleted proposal was in this link: [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/0x32a19b0132c8e2e6c19bf3cd74138416f9a5f780e672a58982d00cbd827813f9). This is the IPFS link for the proposal (that does not contain the votes): https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmbDBvUJNhyaWUu1nhGPSEpuCxqhWP9hwC2FdQuJNM1tVY\n\nAs an alternative, this is the IPFS of signed votes for proposers: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYwumh4oS8N6iUvqEEhsJZkaN2DY7dfkcvrNRttzAoUTP?filename=ipfs_signed_proposors.txt. This list was provided by Laurent Genoud, developer and admin of the official Snapshot Telegram group ([Telegram: Contact @snapshotlabs](https://t.me/snapshotlabs/7972)).\n\nThe poll was used in order to guarantee that proposers belonged to the registry.

        "body": "> HIP: 36\n> title: Registration Validity Extension and Change of Renewal Period\n> author: @senryu @NingFid @fnanni \n> status: Phase 3\n> created: 2022-02-01\n\n\n\n**Simple Summary**\n\nThe validity of a registered profile is 1 year. This proposal aims to extend the duration of each profile to 2 years and change the renewal period duration to 3 months.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nTo prevent high attrition in the registry due to renewal cost and simultaneous $UBI sell-off to fund renewal, we propose a change on the validity of the registered profiles through a change of the parameter `submissionDuration` to 2 years.\n\nMoreover, the current setup to remove registered profiles is halted for the entire renewal duration of 6 months which is too long of ‘immunity’ period for possibly missed non-conforming and/or suspicious profiles. Another issue that was brought up is for those who wish to be removed but cannot initiate it(no option)until the 6-month renewal period is over. This can be done through a parameter change of of `renewalPeriodDuration` to 3 months.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIn order for the Proof of Humanity protocol to maintain the momentum in registration and remain as the largest on-chain identity system, we need to address the pain points in submission primarily the total cost to register and renew.\n\nWhile the ETH usd value halved since [Phase 1](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-36-extending-the-registration-period-to-avoid-gas-costs/1538/4), ETH price forecast remains positive in the long term due to Ethereum’s widespread use (https://cryptofees.info/; https://money-movers.info/; ) and net issuance (https://watchtheburn.com/insights) relatively lower than the burned ETH from fees as of today. Might sound more speculative than concrete motivation to push this proposal through, but the Proof of Humanity registration being denominated in ETH is significantly affected by price changes.\n\nMoreover, there are few other preceding profile submission requirement alterations being proposed [HIP-32](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-32-define-text-to-be-read-for-profile-renewal/1157),   [HIP 33](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-33-registry-protection-against-puppet-and-farming-attacks/1357/2),  [HIP 27](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275) that are yet to be implemented and may be enforced at the same time as many profiles need renewing. We need more time to re-educate users and curators of the new process as we strive to balance fair incentivization and high-quality curated sybil-proof list of humans.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe proposed parameter changes on submissionDuration and renewalPeriodDuration will affect profiles:\n\n* About to expire after 1 year in the registry\n* Have renewed prior to the change and will have the new validity as specified in the change\n* Current registrants not in renewal period\n* Incoming submissions\n\n**Implementation**\n\nA transaction with the following specifications is expected to be executed from the Proof of Humanity governor:\n\n* Contract address: 0xC5E9dDebb09Cd64DfaCab4011A0D5cEDaf7c9BDb.\n* Function: changeDurations(uint64 _submissionDuration, uint64 _renewalPeriodDuration, uint64 _challengePeriodDuration).\n* Function parameters:\n– `_submissionDuration`: 63115200 (twice the current value, i.e. 2 years).\n– `_renewalPeriodDuration`: 7889400 (half of the current value, i.e. 3 months).\n– `_challengePeriodDuration`: 302400 (stays the same).\n* Value to be sent: 0 ETH.",

A poll made on Snapshot was used to gather a list of addresses of people interested in having that role.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOriginal and deleted proposal was in this link: [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/0x32a19b0132c8e2e6c19bf3cd74138416f9a5f780e672a58982d00cbd827813f9). This is the IPFS link for the proposal (that does not contain the votes): https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmbDBvUJNhyaWUu1nhGPSEpuCxqhWP9hwC2FdQuJNM1tVY\n\nAs an alternative, this is the IPFS of signed votes for proposers: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYwumh4oS8N6iUvqEEhsJZkaN2DY7dfkcvrNRttzAoUTP?filename=ipfs_signed_proposors.txt. This list was provided by Laurent Genoud, developer and admin of the official Snapshot Telegram group ([Telegram: Contact @snapshotlabs](https://t.me/snapshotlabs/7972)).\n\nThe poll was used in order to guarantee that proposers belonged to the registry. There was only one option “I offer myself as Proposer”.

This proposal aims to extend the duration of each profile to 2 years and change the renewal period duration to 3 months.\n \nAbstract\n\nTo prevent high attrition in the registry due to renewal cost and simultaneous $UBI sell-off to fund renewal, we propose a change on the validity of the registered profiles through a change of the parameter submissionDuration to 2 years. \nMoreover, the current setup to remove registered profiles is halted for the entire renewal duration of 6 months which is too long of ‘immunity’ period for possibly missed non-conforming and/or suspicious profiles. Another issue that was brought up is for those who wish to be removed but cannot initiate it(no option)until the 6-month renewal period is over. This can be done through a parameter change of renewalPeriodDuration to 3 months.\n \n \nMotivation\n\nIn order for the Proof of Humanity protocol to maintain the momentum in registration and remain as the largest on-chain identity system, we need to address the pain points in submission primarily the total cost to register and renew. \n \nWhile the ETH usd value halved since Phase 1, ETH price forecast remains positive in the long term due to Ethereum’s widespread use (https://cryptofees.info/; https://money-movers.info/; ) and net issuance (https://watchtheburn.com/insights) relatively lower than the burned ETH from fees as of today. Might sound more speculative than concrete motivation to push this proposal through, but the Proof of Humanity registration being denominated in ETH is significantly affected by price changes.\n\nMoreover, there are few other preceding profile submission requirement alterations being proposed HIP-32 https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-32-define-text-to-be-read-for-profile-renewal/1157 HIP 33 https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-33-registry-protection-against-puppet-and-farming-attacks/1357/2\nHIP 27 https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275\nthat are yet to be implemented and may be enforced at the same time as many profiles need renewing. We need more time to re-educate users and curators of the new process as we strive to balance fair incentivization and high-quality curated sybil-proof list of humans.\n \nSpecification\n\nThe proposed parameter changes on submissionDuration and renewalPeriodDuration will affect profiles:\n- About to expire after 1 year in the registry\n- Have renewed prior to the change and will have the new validity as specified in the change\n- Current registrants not in renewal period\n- Incoming submissions\n \nDiscussions found in the threads:\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/extending-the-registration-period-with-one-year/1316?u=ningfid\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-36-extending-the-registration-period-to-avoid-gas-costs/1538?u=ningfid\n ",

This proposal would make it so a single such mistake would no longer be grounds for rejection. This would not reduce the security of the profile or the PoH registry in any practical terms as will be demonstrated below.\nMotivation\n\nSubmitters will often write down their address by hand instead of printing it or displaying it on another screen. This might be because they don’t have a printer or another device with a screen they can easily display it on, or simply because they find writing the address by hand to be more convenient at that time.\n\nAs one might expect, it is often the case that submitters make mistakes when copying their address. Sometimes, these are significant errors such as the omission of a large part of the address, in which case it might be possible for an attacker to generate matching addresses, but often the error will affect only one character. We may distinguish 4 types of errors:\n\n```\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n\nThis proposal would allow at most one of the above three errors in a displayed address. The effects on the security of an address (i.e. on the ability of an attacker to find a private key generating an address which would match the displayed address) would be the following:\n\n```\n- omitted character: 9.32 bits: lg(40*16): 40 positions to insert the missing character which has 16 possible values\n- mistaken character: 9.23 bits: lg(40*15): 40 characters with 15 possible invalid values each\n- swapped adjacent characters: 5.29 bits: lg(39): 39 possible swaps of adjacent characters, although note that this can be slightly lower still since not all swaps have an effect (e.g. in “abbd”, swapping the two \"b\"s has no effect)\n- additional character: 5.36 bits: lg(41): 41 choices for which character to delete\n```\n\nNote that if a character is missing (case 1.) the three other cases are no longer allowed, and conversely, if the displayed address has all 40 characters (case 2. and 3.), the first and fourth cases are no longer allowed, and if there is an extra character, then only case 4. may be considered. As a result the maximum security loss is max(lg(N_1), lg(N_2 + N_3), lg(N_4)) = max(9.32, 9.32, 5.36) = 9.32 bits, reducing the total security of an address from 160 to 150.68 bits. Given the low stakes involved in being able to create a fake profile with an existing PoH registration video and the fact that no one is likely to be able to crack 150 bits of an Ethereum key for the foreseeable future, this should be an acceptable security compromise.\n\nAt this point, it is worth noting that there is one disadvantage to this proposal: It will no longer be possible to find a person’s profile from the video alone without trying all possible allowed errors, which is to say 639 trials in the worst case. This is easily remedied with a simple software loop, but something to keep in mind.\n\n## Specification\nThe following text will be appended at the end of the first bullet point of subsection 4. of the “List of current required/optional elements and submission rules”:\n```\nA single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n\nAs stated on the effects on security, 1 character does not add a great impact on security, but it does greatly impact on UX and humans registering making honest mistakes. \nIt could be argued that in a future time, we could be allowing more characters mistakes, which would lead to a slippery slope. The key point is to maintain security and adding more characters would have a greater impact on security. 1 character mistakes can be considered as a good balance between honest mistakes while maintaining security.\n\n## Mission Board Ratification\nSince this HIP has been recreated from an existing phase 2, the proposers have asked the Mission Boards to ratify the validity of this HIP. The board's vote on this phase 3 is proof enough that they confirm it's validity. (See https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/special-binding-mission-board-ratification-hip-27/1417)\n",

        "body": "```\nHIP: 27\ntitle: Allow 1-character mistakes in displayed addresses\nauthor: @Mizu @juanu\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2021-11-19\n```\n## Simple Summary\nThis proposal would modify the registry policy to allow for limited mistakes or omissions in the address displayed in a profile’s video.\n\n## Abstract\nMany profiles get challenged due to mistakes affecting a single character in the address displayed by the submitter in their video. This proposal would make it so a single such mistake would no longer be grounds for rejection. This would not reduce the security of the profile or the PoH registry in any practical terms as will be demonstrated below.\nMotivation\n\nSubmitters will often write down their address by hand instead of printing it or displaying it on another screen. This might be because they don’t have a printer or another device with a screen they can easily display it on, or simply because they find writing the address by hand to be more convenient at that time.\n\nAs one might expect, it is often the case that submitters make mistakes when copying their address. Sometimes, these are significant errors such as the omission of a large part of the address, in which case it might be possible for an attacker to generate matching addresses, but often the error will affect only one character. We may distinguish 4 types of errors:\n\n```\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n\nThis proposal would allow at most one of the above three errors in a displayed address. The effects on the security of an address (i.e. on the ability of an attacker to find a private key generating an address which would match the displayed address) would be the following:\n\n```\n- omitted character: 9.32 bits: lg(40*16): 40 positions to insert the missing character which has 16 possible values\n- mistaken character: 9.23 bits: lg(40*15): 40 characters with 15 possible invalid values each\n- swapped adjacent characters: 5.29 bits: lg(39): 39 possible swaps of adjacent characters, although note that this can be slightly lower still since not all swaps have an effect (e.g. in “abbd”, swapping the two \"b\"s has no effect)\n- additional character: 5.36 bits: lg(41): 41 choices for which character to delete\n```\n\nNote that if a character is missing (case 1.) the three other cases are no longer allowed, and conversely, if the displayed address has all 40 characters (case 2. and 3.), the first and fourth cases are no longer allowed, and if there is an extra character, then only case 4. may be considered. As a result the maximum security loss is max(lg(N_1), lg(N_2 + N_3), lg(N_4)) = max(9.32, 9.32, 5.36) = 9.32 bits, reducing the total security of an address from 160 to 150.68 bits. Given the low stakes involved in being able to create a fake profile with an existing PoH registration video and the fact that no one is likely to be able to crack 150 bits of an Ethereum key for the foreseeable future, this should be an acceptable security compromise.\n\nAt this point, it is worth noting that there is one disadvantage to this proposal: It will no longer be possible to find a person’s profile from the video alone without trying all possible allowed errors, which is to say 639 trials in the worst case. This is easily remedied with a simple software loop, but something to keep in mind.\n\n## Specification\nThe following text will be appended at the end of the first bullet point of subsection 4. of the “List of current required/optional elements and submission rules”:\n```\nA single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n--\n- See [Republish motivation](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275#republish-motivation)\n- See [Effects on Security](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275#specification)",

Current phrase states \"...and that I am not already registered in this registry\" which would be false for already registered users. The primary aim for this proposal would be to clearly define what the phrase should be.\n\n# Motivation\nThe renewals beginning in the following month is going to trigger more opportunistic challenges due to lack of clarification of the current text.\n\n# Specification\nAn upgrade to the metadata document should be added which will specify the renewal procedure.\nAdd a section with title \"Elements required for renewal\" and say\n\n> The renewal procedure will follow the same rules than the registry procedure **except:**\n> * The renewer must say <to be defined, see below>. Renewers should speak in their normal voice and should not attempt mimicking someone else’s voice. Speaking before or after the required sentence is acceptable. Poor English accents, mispronunciations, and the switch or oversight of words in that sentence are not grounds for rejections\n> * The sign should display in a readable manner the <time validation options, se below> \n\n## Proposed new phrases in English\n- “I certify that I am a real human and that I am renewing my registration on this registry” by @juanu\n- “I certify that I am a real human and that I am re-applying for this registry” by @Koki\n- \"“I certify that I am a real human, and this is my video for Proof of Humanity.” by @ruben\n\n## Proposed alternatives for time validation\nThe sign should show an ethereum blockhash, which could be \n* the time when the renewer clicked on the \"renew\" button. \n* some periodical reference time in the recent past, for example the midnight UTC of last day, or 00:01:00 UTC of the first day of each month. \n\nThe way that this time validation is generated should be less mistake-prone for the renewer, and easier/faster for the challenger to catch a mismatch. A solution that could prevent long character strings is to shorten the hash into an even shorter hash through some shortening algorithm. Ideally it would consist of 4-6 characters.\n\n---\n# Resumen simple\nAclarar cuál debe ser la frase para la renovación del perfil. \n\n# Resumen\nAhora que ha comenzado el periodo de renovación para algunos, hay algunas cuestiones relacionadas con la frase que debe utilizarse para la renovación. La frase actual dice \"...y que no esté ya inscrito en este registro\" lo cual sería falso para los usuarios ya registrados. El objetivo principal de esta propuesta sería definir claramente cuál debe ser la frase.\n\n# Motivación\nLas renovaciones que comienzan en el mes siguiente van a desencadenar más impugnaciones oportunistas debido a la falta de aclaración del texto actual.\n\n# Especificación\nDebería añadirse una actualización del documento de metadatos que especifique el procedimiento de renovación.\nAñadir una sección con el título \"Elementos necesarios para la renovación\" y decir\n\n> El procedimiento de renovación seguirá las mismas reglas que el procedimiento de registro **excepto:** > El renovador debe decir <a definir, véase más adelante>. Los renovadores deben hablar con su voz normal y no deben intentar imitar la voz de otra persona. Se acepta hablar antes o después de la frase requerida. El acento inglés deficiente, la mala pronunciación y el cambio u omisión de palabras en esa frase no son motivo de rechazo\n> * El cartel debe mostrar de manera legible las <opciones de validación de tiempo, se abajo> \n\n## Nuevas frases propuestas en inglés\n- \"Certifico que soy un humano real y que renuevo mi inscripción en este registro\" por @juanu\n- \"Certifico que soy un humano real y que vuelvo a solicitar mi inscripción en este registro\" por @Koki\n- \"Certifico que soy un humano real y que este es mi vídeo para la Prueba de Humanidad\" por @ruben\n\n## Alternativas propuestas para la validación del tiempo\nEl cartel debería mostrar un blockhash de ethereum, que podría ser \n* la hora en que el renovador hizo clic en el botón \"renovar\". \n* alguna hora de referencia periódica en el pasado reciente, por ejemplo la medianoche UTC del último día, o las 00:01:00 UTC del primer día de cada mes. \n\nLa forma en que se genera esta validación de la hora debería ser menos propensa a errores para el renovador, y más fácil para el retador para detectar un error. Una solución que podría evitar las cadenas de caracteres largas es acortar el hash en un hash aún más corto a través de algún algoritmo de acortamiento. Lo ideal sería que consistiera en 4-6 caracteres\n\n\n",

It should also be displayed on the forum.\nA board member can also post this proposal on the current snapshot page.\nIf the amount of \"Change the board composition and snapshot page\" votes on any of the snapshot page exceeds the amount of \"Make no change\" on both snapshot pages, the proposal changing the board and snapshot page is accepted.\nIn case no proposal is created by a board member within the voting period of the proposal on the new snapshot page and the amount of \"Change the board composition and snapshot page\" exceeds the amount of \"Make no change\", the proposal changing the board and snapshot page is also accepted.\n- In case of proposals/votes being censored by snapshot a similar process can be used to change the voting platform to a new platform (in this case the board composition isn't changed).\n- A Proof Of Humanity polls snapshot page can be created for non enforcing polling.",

        "body": "HIP: 27\ntitle: Allow 1-character mistakes in displayed addresses\nauthor: Mizu\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2021-09-14\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal would modify the registry policy to allow for limited mistakes or omissions in the address displayed in a profile’s video.\n\n## Abstract\n\nMany profiles get challenged due to mistakes affecting a single character in the address displayed by the submitter in their video. This proposal would make it so a single such mistake would no longer be grounds for rejection. This would not reduce the security of the profile or the PoH registry in any practical terms as will be demonstrated below.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSubmitters will often write down their address by hand instead of printing it or displaying it on another screen. This might be because they don’t have a printer or another device with a screen they can easily display it on, or simply because they find writing the address by hand to be more convenient at that time.\n\nAs one might expect, it is often the case that submitters make mistakes when copying their address. Sometimes, these are significant errors such as the omission of a large part of the address, in which case it might be possible for an attacker to generate matching addresses, but often the error will affect only one character. We may distinguish 4 types of errors:\n\n1. omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n2. mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n3. swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”)\n4. additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n\nThis proposal would allow at most one of the above three errors in a displayed address. The effects on the security of an address (i.e. on the ability of an attacker to find a private key generating an address which would match the displayed address) would be the following:\n\n1. omitted character: 9.32 bits: lg(40*16): 40 positions to insert the missing character which has 16 possible values\n2. mistaken character: 9.23 bits: lg(40*15): 40 characters with 15 possible invalid values each\n3. swapped adjacent characters: 5.29 bits: lg(39): 39 possible swaps of adjacent characters, although note that this can be slightly lower still since not all swaps have an effect (e.g. in “abbd”, swapping the two \"b\"s has no effect)\n4. additional character: 5.36 bits: lg(41): 41 choices for which character to delete\n\nNote that if a character is missing (case 1.) the three other cases are no longer allowed, and conversely, if the displayed address has all 40 characters (case 2. and 3.), the first and fourth cases are no longer allowed, and if there is an extra character, then only case 4. may be considered. As a result the maximum security loss is max(lg(N_1), lg(N_2 + N_3), lg(N_4)) = max(9.32, 9.32, 5.36) = 9.32 bits, reducing the total security of an address from 160 to 150.68 bits. Given the low stakes involved in being able to create a fake profile with an existing PoH registration video and the fact that no one is likely to be able to crack 150 bits of an Ethereum key for the foreseeable future, this should be an acceptable security compromise.\n\nAt this point, it is worth noting that there is one disadvantage to this proposal: It will no longer be possible to find a person’s profile from the video alone without trying all possible allowed errors, which is to say 639 trials in the worst case. This is easily remedied with a simple software loop, but something to keep in mind.\n\nIt will also be desirable to make the conventional “0x” prefix explicitly optional too since it does not really serve a purpose and people have occasionally been penalized for omitting it.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following text will be appended at the end of the first bullet point of subsection 4. of the “List of current required/optional elements and submission rules”:\n\n> The displayed address need not contain the prefix “0x”. A single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n> \n> 1. omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n> 2. mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n> 3. swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”)\n> 4. additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)",

The UBI token will have moving forward a specific DAO of its own, where holders of UBI will be able to vote with their stake and thus make decisions that will have influence over the [UBI smart contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd1ad9a21ce722c151a836373babe42c868ce9a4).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn order to increase the demand-side pressure, improving the utility of the UBI token by making it useful for governance decisions that influence its own smart contract shall have a positive impact in price over the long term and incentivize long term accumulation from investors and holders. Governance staking has proven to be an effective influence for long term holding across multiple DeFi projects and from a legitimacy perspective, it makes sense that those with \"skin in the game\" get to advance the interests of UBI token holders.\n\nAlso, taking into consideration that UBI gets airdropped evenly to every verified human on Proof of Humanity, we don't consider this puts at risk the democratic ideals that we pursue as a community. On the contrary: this is aimed at increasing the value of UBI over the long term which shall ultimately benefit every Proof of Humanity member.\n\n## Specification\n\n###  The DAO\n\n1. UBI shall have a Snapshot page of its own where holders of UBI that are verified Proof of Humanity accounts will be able to vote with their holdings of UBI.  \n\n2. A Kleros Governor shall be setup to enforce on-chain the off-chain votes expressed on the UBI DAO.\n\n3. The DAO shall implement a Quadratic Voting scheme where holders will be able to vote with their stake but whales will be mitigated from excessively influencing the outcome of votes since the votes will be computed using the following formula: \n```\n(voting power = sqrt(balance) * isHuman())\n```\n\n4. From the treasury of the Proof of Humanity DAO that originally consisted of 4 million UBI, 50% will be sent to the UBI DAO (2 million UBI). This will not have impact over the ETH or any other assets currently under the custody of the Proof of Humanity DAO.\n\n### Implementation\n\n* The [UBIProxy.sol](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ubi/blob/master/contracts/UBIProxy.sol) smart contract will be used to create the UBIVOTE token as a proxy for the Snapshot page of UBI since it follows the voting formula specified above.\n\n* A Snapshot Page for UBI DAO will be created using the UBIVOTE token.\n\n* A Kleros Governor will be created to enforce on chain decisions made on the UBI DAO — The UBI Governor.\n\n* The UBI token smart contract proxy will be managed by the new UBI Governor created for the UBI DAO.\n\n* 2 million UBI from the [Proof of Humanity DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x327a29fce0a6490e4236240be176daa282eccfdf) will be transfered to the UBI Governor.  \n\n### Additional Notes\n\nLarge holders of UBI that are not verified as Proof of Humanity members won't be able to participate in the DAO. This means that in order to engage with the DAO, UBI holdings must be used directly from a verified Proof of Humanity address. This will help understand the distribution of UBI across multiple accounts and measure the Gini coefficient of the community over the long term. \n\n### We Are United 💪\n\nLast but not least, this is by no means a split of the Proof of Humanity & UBI projects. They both share the same community and must remain connected through the User Interfaces that connect their smart contracts together so current and future users will begin accruing UBI once they finalize their profile.",

Currently, in the first round of Kleros disputes for Proof of Humanity cases, three jurors are drawn to rule on the case. This number of jurors was initially selected to ensure greater stability in rulings and a lower number of appeals while the registry was in its infancy. The deposit that new submitters to the list have to make needs to include enough ETH so that if the submission is ultimately challenged and rejected, the arbitration fees paid to those jurors can be taken from that deposit. Hence, if one starts with initial panels of only a single juror to judge Proof of Humanity cases, this reduces the size of required deposits to submit to the list.\n\nRecall that Kleros is a Schelling point based system and jurors are incentivized based on whether they are coherent with the final juror vote. Hence even when starting with only one juror, there is an incentive for that single juror to vote seriously because there is a potential for appeal. So if people think the juror voted incorrectly, there is likely to be an appeal and the first round juror would be rewarded or penalized based on what the appeal jurors decide. So far Kleros has used first round panels of only a single juror for Linguo (https://linguo.kleros.io/)\n\nThe negatives are that some borderline cases might not be appealed, so there is an added level of variability in terms of whether the first round juror represents how a larger panel would have voted, and that in (the minority of) cases where there is an appeal and you wind up back with a three juror panel anyway, there is an additional delay and some extra gas to have gone through the one juror round.",

The UBI token will have moving forward a specific DAO of its own, where holders of UBI will be able to vote with their stake and thus make decisions that will have influence over the [UBI smart contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd1ad9a21ce722c151a836373babe42c868ce9a4).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn order to increase the demand-side pressure, improving the utility of the UBI token by making it useful for governance decisions that influence its own smart contract shall have a positive impact in price over the long term and incentivize long term accumulation from investors and holders. Governance staking has proven to be an effective influence for long term holding across multiple DeFi projects and from a legitimacy perspective, it makes sense that those with \"skin in the game\" get to advance the interests of UBI token holders.\n\nAlso, taking into consideration that UBI gets airdropped evenly to every verified human on Proof of Humanity, we don't consider this puts at risk the democratic ideals that we pursue as a community. On the contrary: this is aimed at increasing the value of UBI over the long term which shall ultimately benefit every Proof of Humanity member.\n\n## Specification\n\n###  The DAO\n\n1. UBI shall have a Snapshot page of its own where holders of UBI that are verified Proof of Humanity accounts will be able to vote with their holdings of UBI.  \n\n2. A Kleros Governor shall be setup to enforce on-chain the off-chain votes expressed on the UBI DAO.\n\n3. The DAO shall implement a Quadratic Voting scheme where holders will be able to vote with their stake but whales will be mitigated from excessively influencing the outcome of votes since the votes will be computed using the following formula: \n```\n(voting power = sqrt(balance) * isHuman())\n```\n\n4. From the treasury of the Proof of Humanity DAO that originally consisted of 4 million UBI, 50% will be sent to the UBI DAO (2 million UBI). This will not have impact over the ETH or any other assets currently under the custody of the Proof of Humanity DAO.\n\n###  Proof of Humanity as UBI holder\n\nSince the Proof of Humanity DAO will remain as one of the largest holders of UBI, it can vote decisions with its UBI holdings but only after such decision has been voted by the members of the Proof of Humanity DAO first using the PoH Snapshot page. \n\n### Implementation\n\nThe [UBIProxy.sol](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ubi/blob/master/contracts/UBIProxy.sol) smart contract will be used as a proxy for the Snapshot page of UBI since it follows the voting formula specified above.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\nLarge holders of UBI that are not verified as Proof of Humanity members won't be able to participate in the DAO. This means that in order to engage with the DAO, UBI holdings must be used directly from a verified Proof of Humanity address. This will help understand the distribution of UBI across multiple accounts and measure the Gini coefficient of the community over the long term. \n\nLast but not least, this is by no means a split of the Proof of Humanity & UBI projects. They both share the same community and must remain connected through the User Interfaces that connect their smart contracts together so current and future users accrue UBI once they finalize their profile.

        "body": "HIP: 17\ntitle: Reduce Number of Kleros Jurors Drawn in First Rounds of POH Cases to One\nauthor: William George\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2021-07-23\n\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-17-reduce-number-of-kleros-jurors-drawn-in-first-rounds-of-poh-cases-to-one/933\n\nSimple Summary\nThis proposal would adjust the parameter that controls how many Kleros jurors are drawn in the first round of disputes concerning Proof of Humanity registrations/removals.\n\nAbstract\nI propose to reduce the registration deposit by specifying that the initial round of a dispute in case of profile registration (or removal request) challenge only draws one juror instead of three.\n\nThis would be done by updating the following Proof of Humanity parameter.\n\nUse changeArbitrator (specifically changing the _arbitratorExtraData) so that the initial round of a dispute only draws 1 juror.\n\nMotivation\nThe goal here is to reduce the value required for deposits, to the degree that this is securely possible. Currently, in the first round of Kleros disputes for Proof of Humanity cases, three jurors are drawn to rule on the case. This number of jurors was initially selected to ensure greater stability in rulings and a lower number of appeals while the registry was in its infancy. The deposit that new submitters to the list have to make needs to include enough ETH so that if the submission is ultimately challenged and rejected, the arbitration fees paid to those jurors can be taken from that deposit. Hence, if one starts with initial panels of only a single juror to judge Proof of Humanity cases, this reduces the size of required deposits to submit to the list.\n\nRecall that Kleros is a Schelling point based system and jurors are incentivized based on whether they are coherent with the final juror vote. Hence even when starting with only one juror, there is an incentive for that single juror to vote seriously because there is a potential for appeal. So if people think the juror voted incorrectly, there is likely to be an appeal and the first round juror would be rewarded or penalized based on what the appeal jurors decide. So far Kleros has used first round panels of only a single juror for Linguo (https://linguo.kleros.io/)\n\nThe negatives are that some borderline cases might not be appealed, so there is an added level of variability in terms of whether the first round juror represents how a larger panel would have voted, and that in (the minority of) cases where there is an appeal and you wind up back with a three juror panel anyway, there is an additional delay and some extra gas to have gone through the one juror round.",

A 5th member and a tie-breaking vote are also added for the case when the board cannot come to unanimous consent. \n\n**Abstract**\nThe Mission Board needs to function also in the case when decisions are disputed. Therefore we need some simple rules for what happens when there is no consensus. This proposal clarifies what happens in case of dispute, clarifies the limit to the power of the board, and adds two tie-breaking mechanisms - a 5th board member and a tie-breaking vote.\n\n**Motivation**\nA board member contacted me about concerns about the functioning of the board. HIP-7 made the board sound too much like management, and the powers could be interpreted too broadly. In addition, it assumed that the board would function completely without disputes, which was a bit naive. So this proposal seeks to address these issues by adding mechanisms for dispute resolution.

Although they are free to do so, it is not the responsibility of the person holding the admin role to moderate dialogue or content creation, which is a role more commonly known as community manager, moderator, facilitator, etc. An admin may be assigned the role of moderator by the authority responsible for that (Product Manager, Mission Board), but moderators assignment and mechanisms are outside of this HIP.\n2. Community-managed channel: a volunteer status for any of the channels in the Scope of this HIP in which there is an agreement of the channel owner/creator to be associated with PoH. It is accompanied by a badge or a seal or any piece of text that clearly recognizes them as such.\n\n### 2. Scope\n\nRoles for admin positions for each of the Community-Managed channels of communication would be temporary roles and elected from the community. These include (non-exhaustive list):\n\n* Discourse forum\n* Twitter\n* Facebook groups\n* Reddit\n* Discord\n* WhatsApp\n* Instagram\n* Telegram groups, users and channels\n\n### Elections\n\n1. Elections are made separately by platform.\n2. Elections should be done in the Tokenlog platform ([here's the current implementation](https://tokenlog.xyz/Proof-Of-Humanity/proof-of-humanity-web), new repositories will be created on Github solely for the purpose of the Administrator election on each of the platforms).\n3. Elections are ongoing.\n4. Elections are made using quadratic voting (negative votes are allowed).\n5. Each Human will receive 99 voting credits.\n6. Ideally, there should be 1 elected admin for every 500 users in a channel (since the position is voluntary, there might be less than 1 elected admin per 500 users).\n7. The top candidates with a positive score will take their positions (e.g. on a channel with 2.715 members, the top 5 candidates with a positive score will become the official Administrators).\n8. Each time one of the official Administrators lose their position on Tokenlog's ranking, the next candidate to come up in the rank will gain the official role as Administrator.\n9. Admin roles should be registered individuals in Proof of Humanity.\n10. Roles are only revocable for security reasons or serious offenses to the community. The Mission Board can call an emergency voting of 24h in Snapshot. Admins revoked in this way cannot re-apply for the role in the next term.\n11. Admin roles are not moderator roles, therefore do not require to suppress their opinions in debates, as long as they follow the code of conduct established for that channel. Mere opposition to that admin’s opinion should not be grounds for the admin to ban that person.\n\n### Administrators obligations\n\nAdministrators acknowledge that access to communication channels or profiles labelled as “admin” gives them an additional power, which comes with additional responsibilities. They are expected to behave as ambassadors of the project. In addition to following the appropriate codes of conduct:\n\n* They should refrain from expressing virulent opinions about Proof Of Humanity or related projects with their admin accounts.\n* They are subject to higher standards in terms of good conduct (ex: avoiding excessive profanity, or engaging in debates on topics outside of Proof of Humanity, such as politics or religion).\n\nThis doesn’t preclude them from formalizing criticism on Proof Of Humanity. However, it should be done either in (i) a technical and dispassionate manner, and preferably offering constructive solutions, or (ii) using a non-admin account.\n\n### “Community-managed” status implementation\n\n1. The owner of any channel of communication within the scope of this HIP can contact the Mission board and apply for the “Community-managed” status.\n2. A call for volunteers is offered in the channel and those members participate in the election process.\n3. Once that process is finished and the elected members are occupying their roles, that channel receives the “community managed” badge, and a link to that channel will be provided in Proof of Humanity project site, and referenced throughout the rest of the channel's ecosystem.\n4. Failure to comply with any aspect of this HIP would trigger the removal of that channel from the “community managed list”\n\n### Special first condition\n\nFor their significance, and to spearhead the value of having the “Community managed” status, the following channels should enter the admin selection process effective immediately:\n\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity https://t.me/proofhumanity\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity en Español https://t.me/proofofhumanityenespanol\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity Chinese https://t.me/ProofOfHumanityCN\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity Portuguese https://t.me/poh_pt\n* Subreddit Proof of Humanity https://www.reddit.com/r/proofofhumanity\n\n## Rationale\n\nCurrently, the admin positions in communication channels that have grown to the thousands of users, were subject to the initiative of the person that first created the channel, (telegram, reddit). These roles right now are virtually permanent, without rules that govern their time in that position, or how or why their roles were assigned. This creates space for centralization and the possibility of indefinite perpetuation in the position, among other issues that arise from this permanence in their role (silencing opposition, pushing a specific agenda, creating a hostile environment, etc.). Some object that this is not an important role to be considered for election, or that this will lead to voting fatigue. There are enough reasons to believe that this proposal will not lead to this sort of problems.\n\n----\n## Version en Español\nDisponible en este link: https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-16-make-admin-roles-of-communication-platforms-eligible/786",

        "body": "```\nHIP: 18\ntitle: Communication roles\nauthor: @clesaege\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2021-06-17\nconflicts with: HIP-16\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n# English version\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP institutes a mechanism to determine the position of administrator in the social communication tools that are recognized as official by the DAO, either social media (twitter, reddit) or communication channels (telegram groups).\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn order to further decentralize positions of enforcement within the DAO, there is the need to create mechanisms in which the role for administrator of the communication channels **generally regarded as official** (*GRAO*, from now on, defined in the Specification section).\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing the spirit of HIP-5, which creates a framework for management of the DAO without altering the smart contract, I propose a better mechanism for establishing enforcing roles within the all recognized channels of communication.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Definitions\n\n1. Administrative role or admin: the position that a person has over a channel of communication, it being social media accounts, forums, instant messaging groups. In this position, the person has privileges to enforce policies or the convened rules of these channels and include muting, removal or admitting the participation of the members of the group, along with other administrative tasks.\n2. Channel Generally Regarded as Official (GRAO): a volunteer status for any of the channels in the scope of this HIP in which there is an agreement of the channel owner/creator to be acting on behalf of Proof Of Humanity.\n\n### Scope\n\nRoles for admin positions for each of the GRAO channels of communication would be temporary roles and elected from the community. These are for example (non exhaustive list):\n\n* Discord forum\n* Twitter\n* Facebook groups\n* Reddit\n* Discord\n* WhatsApp\n* Instagram\n* Telegram groups, users and channels\n\n### Elections\n\n1. Elections are made separately by platform.\n2. Before any election is held on a platform, the mission board assumes the administrative powers (each board member counting as an administrator).\n3. For platforms controlled by the mission board, 3 members wishing to be candidate can call for an election.\n4. When they do so, there is a 1 week period to let time for other candidates to apply.\n5. Elections are made using quadratic voting (negative votes are allowed). *\n6. Each Human will receive 99 voting credits.\n7. The top 3 candidates with a positive score would be elected.\n8. If there are less than 3 candidates with a positive score, there may be less than 3 admins for this channel.\n9. Admin roles are to be elected for a period of 1 year.\n10. In case the mission board believes some administrator is harming the Proof Of Humanity interest, it can call an emergency 24h vote to remove an administrator.\n\n* Currently we will use tokenlog for those votes. If a dedicated voting system becomes available, the DAO could switch to use it. Note that in the current state of tokenlog the interface may not natively support delegations (either not count delegations or allows both the elector and delegate votes to be counted resulting in a double count), we may initially need to run a script to give the results (accounting for delegations) but if possible a proper interface would be used.\n\n## Administrators obligations\n\nAdministrators acknowledge that access to communication channels or profiled labelled as “admin” give them an additional power which comes with additional responsibilities. They are expected to behave as ambassadors of the project. In addition to following the appropriate codes of conduct:\n\n* They should refrain from expressing virulent opinions about Proof Of Humanity or related projects with their admin accounts.\n* They are subject to higher standards in term of good conduct (ex: avoiding excessive profanity).\n\nThis doesn’t preclude them from formalizing criticism on Proof Of Humanity. However, it should be done either in a purely technical manner, or using a non-admin account.\n\n## Conflict with [HIP-16](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-16-make-admin-roles-of-communication-platforms-eligible/786)\n\nThis proposal is an alternate version of HIP-16 with a few modifications. In case both those proposals were to be accepted, another direct vote (which would not have to go through the classic HIP process) would be required:\n\n> Which HIP should take precedence?\n>\n>\n>\n> * HIP-16\n> * HIP-18\n\n## Delegations\n\nAdministrators can delegate their administrative powers to anyone they see fit. They can remove delegations they made at any time without having to provide any justification.\nIn case an elected administrators disagree on a delegation made by another administrator, the administrators conduct a vote. In case of removal or tied result, the delegate have their delegation removed.\n\n## Rationale\n\nCurrently, the admin positions in communication channels *GRAO*, were subject to the initiative of the person that first created the channel, (telegram, reddit). These roles right now are virtually permanent, without rules that govern their time in that position, or how or why their roles were assigned. This creates space for centralization and the possibility of indefinite perpetuation in the position, among other issues that arise from this permanence in their role (silencing opposition, pushing a specific agenda, creating a hostile environment, etc.). We’ve seen that different admins sometimes have significant divergence of opinion about how channels should be handled and it had led to a few virulent discussions. This proposal establishes a clear and objective way people are added or removed from admin positions.\nThis proposal is mainly taken from HIP-16 but with some changes in the details to make it more practical (allowing delegations, having higher standards for administrator conduct) and to clarify the voting method.",

Definiciones \n1. Rol administrativo o admin: es la posición que una persona tiene sobre un canal de comunicación, siendo cuentas de medios sociales, foros, grupos de mensajería instantánea. En esta posición, la persona tiene privilegios para hacer cumplir las políticas o las reglas convocadas de estos canales e incluyen silenciar, eliminar o admitir la participación de los miembros del grupo, junto con otras tareas administrativas.\n2. Canal Generalmente Considerado como Oficial (GRAO): es un estatus voluntario para cualquiera de los canales en el `Ámbito` de este HIP en el que existe un acuerdo del propietario/creador del canal para ser asociado al PoH. \n### Alcance\n1. Los roles para los puestos de administrador para cada uno de los canales de comunicación de GRAO serían roles temporales y elegidos entre la comunidad. Estos son:\n  * Foro de discordia\n  * Twitter\n  * Grupos de Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Discord\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Instagram\n  * Grupos, usuarios y canales de Telegram\n\n### Elecciones\n1. Los roles de administrador se elegirán durante un período de 6 meses, a partir de la fecha y hora de finalización de la encuesta de Instantánea. \n2. Las elecciones deben realizarse en la plataforma Snapshot.  \n3. Para evitar empates en las decisiones conflictivas dentro del rol, se nombrará un número impar de administradores, idealmente 3 (o 5, dependiendo del tamaño y complejidad de la plataforma): \n   * 2 (o 3) pertenecientes a la mayoría elegida\n   * 1 (o 2) perteneciente a la minoría elegida \n4. Los roles de administrador deben ser personas registradas\n5. Las listas de candidatos deben ser publicadas y fijadas (si están disponibles) en la plataforma respectiva. El período de candidatura comienza 3 semanas antes de la fecha de renovación de los administradores y termina una semana antes de la fecha de renovación.\n6. Por el momento, se podría permitir la reelección para el rol. \n7. Los roles sólo son revocables por razones de seguridad o por ofensas graves a la comunidad. El Consejo de la Misión puede convocar una votación de emergencia de 24 horas en Snapshot. Los administradores revocados de este modo no podrán volver a solicitar el rol en el siguiente mandato. \n8. Los roles de admin no son roles de moderador, por lo tanto no requieren suprimir sus opiniones en los debates, siempre y cuando sigan el código de conducta establecido para ese canal. La mera oposición a la opinión de ese admin no debe ser motivo para que el admin banee a esa persona.\n\n## Justificación\nActualmente, los puestos de admin en los canales de comunicación *GRAO*, estaban sujetos a la iniciativa de la persona que creó primero el canal, (telegram, reddit). Estos roles ahora mismo son prácticamente permanentes, sin reglas que regulen su tiempo en esa posición, o cómo o por qué fueron asignados sus roles. Esto crea un espacio para la centralización y la posibilidad de perpetuarse indefinidamente en el puesto, entre otros problemas que surgen de esta permanencia en su rol (silenciar a la oposición, impulsar una agenda específica, crear un ambiente hostil, etc.). Algunos objetan que este no es un papel importante para ser considerado para la elección, o que esto conducirá a la fatiga del voto. Hay suficientes razones para creer que esta propuesta no dará lugar a este tipo de problemas.\n\nTraducción realizada con la versión gratuita del traductor www.DeepL.com/Translator",

        "body": "https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-7-institute-a-mission-board/424\n\nSummary\nThis proposal is to create a board of members with the responsibility of managing the DAO resources (employees, websites, money) in accordance with democratic decisions. In addition, the current group of people managing the website, snapshot, and forum are designated as an interim board for the duration of 1 year after approval.\n\nAbstract\nFor the DAO to function, it requires trusted members to act as advisors to the management as well as a check on it. This board should handle the access to funds and resources to the management, monitor their performance, and ensure that the technical implementation of voting and other procedures are securely implemented.\n\nThese tasks are naturally already handled by the informal leaders instituted by the creators of the Dao. However, this proposal would give them a formal mandate by the community and put a time limit before the board positions would become individually elected.\n\nSince the DAO does not yet have a robust mechanism for voting the second part of the proposal is that the current members filling this task from Kleros and Democracy.Earth will be formalized as the interim board for the period of 1 year after approval.\n\nMotivation\nAt the moment, the creators of the DAO have control of all resources as a trusted group. However, to have a democratic institution this power needs to be under democratic control. In addition, the employees of the DAO need to be treated consistently by the same group of people to ensure good working conditions.\n\nSpecification\nThe current informal managers, from Kleros and Democracy.Earth are formalized as the “Mission Board” for a period of 1 year after adoption.\nThe initial board: @santisiri, @Herb @clesaege and @federicoast\n\nThereafter elections should be held for the positions on the board before the end of the 1-year interim period.\n\nThe mission board will jointly manage the following:\n\nTechnical implementation of voting\nAccess to critical wallets.\nAccess right to funds by management\nPayment to employees\nAny resource requiring high trust by the community\nIn addition, the board will\n\nAdvise management, administer their payment, and monitor their performance.\nAdjudicate if the proper procedure is followed on passing proposals.\nBe authorized to issue mission statements on behalf of the DAO.\nConflict of interests\n\nA position of the mission board is incompatible with any other paid or elected position in the DAO.\nA board member applying or running for a position in the DAO must first step down from the board before they can be considered.\nA person running for the board can have another paid or elected position in the DAO, while applying or running, but must immediately terminate this position upon entering the board.\nRationale\nThe proposal is meant to improve democratic control but not disrupt current operations. The role of the board is what is already being done by a trusted group or will be done in the near future. But this group would have some difficulty explaining their special role with no democratic mandate.\n\nWe could decide to elect a board immediately, but since we don’t yet have defined voting robust procedures we would run a serious risk of taking a lot of time with this and disrupting the progress on other fronts. This is why the option of elevating the current informal leaders to elected (accept/reject) status but for only 1 year.\n\nBoard members should not be allowed to have or apply for any other position in the DAO. The board is tasked with managing the voting systems and could therefore potentially rig it in their own favor. And the same goes because they manage the resources for management.\n\nImplementation\nNothing really changes, except that elections must be held for the board positions before the year is out. If possible the board members should be marked as such on Discourse.",

        "body": "https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-14-lock-the-1-ubi-hour-person-issuance-rate/626\n\nSimple Summary\nThe proposal is to elevate the issuance rate of 1 $UBI/hour/person to a formal decision and allow no other form of $UBI issuance. Furthermore to lock the decision using the locking mechanism proposed in HIP-10.\n\nAbstract\nThe issuance rate of $UBI is 1 $UBI/hour/person, which seems to be very satisfactory to the community. However, we lack a decision specifying this issuance rate. This proposal formally adopts this issuance rate and bans all other forms of issuance - for instance putting tokens directly into the DAO account. In addition, the decision will be locked using the new HIP-10 mechanism, which will need to pass before this proposal can be put to a final vote. The decision is mostly about sending a signal to ourselves and others that the issuance rate is holy and will not be changed, ever.\n\nMotivation\nA good currency needs dependability - if it operates under rules that are unlikely to change then people will be more likely to trust it. The burning rate question will be left open, but just fixing the issuance rate will already make future supply much easier to predict.\nAnd future problems can be addressed within changing issuance:\n\nIf we need to raise the income, then we but increase the value of the token.\nIf we need money, we but get outside funding or increase revenue.\n\nLocking Motivation\nLocking the decision will send a signal to ourselves and others that $UBI will never be changed. This will deflate arguments against investing time and money in the currency because “the DAO could just put 3 million in its account at any time.”\n\nSpecification\nThe $UBI token will be issued at a rate of 1 $UBI/hour/human.\nNo other issuance of $UBI will be allowed.\n\nRationale\nThis proposal was split off from HIP-10 as a separate proposal because it had too great an impact on the future of the DAO.",

This locking mechanism can either be applied to new or existing decisions.\n\nMotivation\nFor some decisions, we need to signal to the world and ourselves that they are very unlikely to be overturned in the future and that it would require a lot of effort to do so. One such decision would be to, for instance, lock the $UBI issuance rate to ensure that people can forecast the value of the currency, improving stability.\n\nSpecification\nThere would be three ways of creating a locked decision.\n\nIn a new proposal, the decision can be locked immediately. A separate section, “Locking Justification”, arguing why this decision should be locked, must be included.\nFor an existing approved proposal, the decision can be locked by creating a new proposal to lock the earlier decision.\nAn existing locked decision can be put up for a new locking vote to increase the reversal threshold further. This new vote requires a separate proposal.\nTo create a valid locking proposal (cases 1-3):\n\nSome version of the verb “Lock” must be included in the title of the proposal topic.\n\nAll minimum poll voting times are doubled both for phase-2 and phase-3.\n\nIn a phase-3 binding vote the word “Locking” must be prepended for the signal poll along with any other required keyword.\n\nHow locking works:\n\nIn a locking vote, a minimum of 60 % approval is needed, if the approval is less then the proposal fails completely.\n\nIf the locking threshold is exceeded then a reversal threshold is set. The reversal threshold will be the approval rate of the proposal, rounded down to the nearest 5 %. So a proposal passing at 74.5 % would later require a 70 % vote to repeal.\n\nIf the reversal threshold would be set to above 90 % by the above rule then it is instead set to 90 %.\n\nIf locked decisions exist the locking mechanism itself can only be repealed by achieving a majority corresponding to the highest reversal threshold of any locked proposal.\n\nAdditions and exceptions to a locked proposal can only be introduced by other locking proposals with an approval rate higher than the reversal threshold.\n\nRationale\nThis implementation allows the community to make reversing a decision very hard - but not impossible. The difficulty of reversing a decision scales with the amount of agreement at an earlier time. Consideration was also to include a requirement that some quorum of voters must participate in the vote, but this was dropped since this would make the difficulty of reversing a decision too linked to user participation which may vary in unpredictable ways over time. The locking of the issuance rate is postponed, since creating a locking mechanism AND using it on something so central would be too much for one vote.",

        "body": "HIP: 13\ntitle: Adopt a management onboarding procedure\nauthor: @Mads\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2021-05-21\namends: HIP-2\n\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-13-phase-2-adopt-a-management-onboarding-procedure/658\n\nSimple Summary\nThis proposal makes rules for how to hire the management of the DAO, excepting this as a special case of the general hiring procedures.\n\nAbstract\nThe management onboarding procedure suggested here is designed to allow applicants to request the resources they need and describe their plan to finance these resources. They can describe who they need to be hired - filling open positions as well as creating new ones. They can suggest dedicated budgets for specific purposes. They also need to describe how these resources are paid for. The budget and financing plan can be as slim (hire me for PM, we will figure it out later) or as expansive as the proposer desires.\n\nThe procedure also sets a way to decide when we pass on to a decision. We use polls to decide how much time we need to decide/wait for more applications, when the date comes we create a poll to either pass to a decision or extend the application process.\n\nMotivation\nThis proposal is inspired by the applications that the DAO received to the product manager position. Two of the applicant, @paulaberman and @HBesso31, applied to the position with one (@paulaberman- Sofia Cossar) or several (@HBesso31 - Ryan Cwynar/Cami Arias/Anna Kaic) required team members.\n\nThis introduces a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem since the DAO is currently only authorized to hire employees individually (through the HIP-2 1) procedure but the applicants will only agree to be hired if they can have their team along. This proposal allows for the flexibility to accept such applications.\n\nIn addition, this proposal also creates a clear path towards a decision by regularly forcing a vote on whether we should move to a decision. This way we may keep the process open, but still signal to the applicants how close we are to being ready, giving a signal of how likely they are to get a decision.\n\nSpecification\nAmending HIP-2: This process is an exception to HIP-2 because it allows hiring by the onboarding plan. This exception should be added to HIP-2.\n\nApplication:\n\nA new thread is created for management onboarding or an existing one is designated for the purpose.\nA decision/re-evaluation decision is made through a snapshot poll.\nThe re-evaluation poll will be “Are we ready to decide on a PM?”, answers “Yes” or “No - extend 1/2/4/8/16 weeks”.\nIf the answer is No we will use the median value of the poll for the number of weeks for the next re-evaluation date (“Yes” counts as 0).\nIf the answer is “Yes” we will close for further applications.\nIf an application comes in during voting, a full week (from the time of the application) must be available for discussion of the new candidate before moving to the next phase.\nAn application must describe their Onboarding plan:\n\nHow to fill open positions (specific people or the process)\nAlternatively, that which open positions should be closed.\nA budget for operation for at least one year.\nA financing plan for at least one year.\nProposer Selection\n\nA 7-day vote is created with all applicants (their handle in Discourse) in random order. “Which is your preferred PM?” Answers (“Applicant 1”/“Applicant 2”/“Applicant 3”)\nThe applicant with the highest vote count will become the current “Proposer”.\nOnboarding:\n\nThe proposer will create a thread with the final onboarding plan which is allowed to be changed from the original application.\nThe Proposer must within one week create a snapshot poll with the title “[Binding] Onboard [Applicant Name]”.\nThe entire Onboarding plan must be pasted in the snapshot poll.\nOn rejection, the applicant with the next highest vote count becomes the new proposer and the application Onboarding phase is repeated.\nIf all candidates are rejected we reopen for the application phase.\nRationale\nThis process is a compromise between setting a deadline, which will allow candidates to plan their lives and keeping our options open. The candidates know when a re-evaluation occurs, and if we do not close for applications, at least they will get an indication of how close we were to closing and a new date giving them more feedback to plan.\n\nThe poll created by @paulaberman on whether to allow teams came back positive so this process allows for such a proposal. If you don’t like a team proposal, you are free to vote against it and/or vote to extend the application period if only team applications are in.\n\nI considered making the proposal repeal HIP-3, however, this is not needed. HIP-3 simply defines two open positions. If these open positions (not specifying full-/part-time) are incompatible with an applicant’s plan then the applicant must argue why these positions should be closed as part of the Onboarding plan.\n\nImplementation\nAny member can take the actions to advance the process as long as the requirements are fulfilled.",

        "body": "**Simple summary**\nMake clear that the definition of 360p does not literally mean 360 pixels, and that certain codecs crop 4 pixel columns from each side of the image. Submissions with 352 pixels wide should not be considered in violation with submission rules.\n\n**Abstract**\nThis amendment proposal is a fast, immediate solution to issues related to a widespread method of video submission… It moves the minimum dimension of the width or height of videos from 360 to 352 to match what is currently capable in the most widespread technology available. The 8 pixels removed cropped by the codec due to ancient PAL analogue norm is not moving the line too much and it fits the technical capability of current widespread technology. It is not realistic to challenge a person because 8 pixel columns are removed from the side of the picture (in the case that is background that is removed from the frame and not actual image). This amendment is final and it is not intended to serve precedent of moving the minimum any further than this.\n\n**Motivation**\nThe most common and easy way for a lay user to submit and transfer a video without additional installations or knowledge is sending it via WhatsApp and downloading it through WhatsApp web. In order to avoid opportunistic challengers that predate in these submissions, that would otherwise be a good-faith submission, an urgent amendment to this policy should be put in place. It would also lift some artificial and clunky methods that current new users are using that degrades the platform in order to meet the requirements (re-encoding video, padding to sides of it, etc.).\n\n**Specification**\nMinimum video dimensions is a square of 352 pixels by 352 pixels. Videos with equal or higher size than stated should not be considered a violation to the rule #4 of submission guidelines. Videos equaling 351 pixels or lower in size in any of their dimensions will violate rule #4.\n\nThis is an interim resolution until more precise video quality submission guidelines are approved.\n\n**Implementation**\nChange the text of rule number #4, replacing this block of text:\n\n    The video quality should be at least 360p, at most 2 minutes long, and in the video/webm, video/MP4, video/avi or video/mov format.\n\nWith this block of text:\n\n    Video submissions must follow all of the following requirements:\n\n       * at most 2 minutes long,\n       * in the video/webm, video/MP4, video/avi or video/mov format,\n       * vertical (portrait), horizontal (landscape) or square,\n\n    and follow these minimum size requirements:\n\n       * Minimum height: equal to or higher than 352 pixels\n       * Minimum width: equal to or higher than 352 pixels\n\n\n\n**Rationale**\nRefer to [Imprecise rule regarding video quality of submissions ](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/imprecise-rule-regarding-video-quality-of-submissions/443)\n\n**Supplementary information**\nSee also forum discussion in https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-8-phase-3-accept-352-as-minimum-dimension-in-video-submissions/536\n\n[Link a versión en español](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-8-phase-3-accept-352-as-minimum-dimension-in-video-submissions/536/22?u=ludovico)",

Submissions with 352 pixels wide should not be considered in violation with submission rules.\n\nAbstract\nThis amendment proposal is a fast, immediate solution to issues related to a widespread method of video submission. It moves the minimum dimension of the width of vertical videos from 360 to 352 to match what is currently capable in the most widespread technology available. The 8 pixels removed cropped by the codec due to ancient PAL analogue norm is not moving the line too much and it fits the technical capability of current widespread technology. It is not realistic to challenge a person because 8 pixels are removed from the side of the picture (in the case that is background that is removed from the frame and not actual image). It is not intended to move the line any further than that.\n\nMotivation\nThe most common and easy way for a lay user to submit and transfer a video without additional installations or knowledge is sending it via WhatsApp and downloading it through WhatsApp web. In order to avoid opportunistic challengers that predate in these submissions, that would otherwise be a good-faith submission, an urgent ammendment to this policy should be put in place. It would also lift some artificial and clunky methods that current new users are using that degrades the platform in order to meet the requirements (re-encoding video, padding to sides of it, etc.).\n\nSpecification\nIf a vertical video in the proportion 16:9 is submitted vertically, then the 352 pixels of width should not be considered a violation to the rule #4 of submission guidelines, since it is still considered 360p.\n\nRationale\nRefer to Imprecise rule regarding video quality of submissions (https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/imprecise-rule-regarding-video-quality-of-submissions/443)",

        "body": "[Link to HIP-5 proposal thread](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-5-adopt-a-proper-poh-dao-governance-process-to-ensure-hip-quality/393)\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal details a process for creating PoH DAO governance proposals and putting them up to vote.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis proposal provides a detailed structured process for PoH DAO governance proposals. Any individual or entity wishing to create a proposal and put it up to vote will need to go through those steps to ensure that its proposal is detailed enough to be voted on and its implementation enforceable.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe recent proposals on [PoH Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth) confused a lot of people in the PoH community. They lack any detailed description, link to a debate on PoH forum, proper structuring of the proposal and it is not clear if they are only for collecting signalling information or if they will be binding. Moreover, some of them invite people to vote on proposals that may not be technically feasible. This proposal will ensure only proposals and polls with the bare minimum quality will reach the snapshot page and avoid voter fatigue in the process.\n\n### Specification\n\n## PoH DAO Governance Process\n\nThe Proof of Humanity governance process is primarily conducted using the [DAO category](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/c/democracy/7) on the Proof of Humanity Governance Forum. For a proposal to be accepted, it must successfully pass through three phases:\n\n# Phase 1: Ideation\n\nThis phase facilitates an initial, informal discussion on PoH Forum regarding potential proposals to PoH DAO. You can initiate a proposal in Phase 1 by posting your idea in the[ DAO category](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/c/democracy/7) with the phase-1 tag. This phase allows proposals to gather community insight for refinement before opening a formal poll.\n\n**Duration:** Open-ended\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 1 to Phase 2, there is no formal requirement. However, if a Phase 1 proposal discussion fails to garner any momentum from the community, it is unlikely to become a successful proposal.\n\n# Phase 2: Specification\n\nThis phase requires proposals to be posted in a new dedicated thread the [DAO category](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/c/democracy/7) using the Humanity Improvement Proposal (HIP) template. You can create a Humanity Improvement Proposal (HIP) easily by adding the HIP subcategory, after which your draft post will automatically be populated by a HIP template for you to fill in. You can move a proposal to Phase 2 by posting the HIP-# with the phase-2 tag.\n\nThe HIP template recommends that all proposals should contain the following fields when applicable , such as a Simple Summary, Abstract, Motivation and Specification.\nIn addition to these fields, Phase 2 proposals must also include a link to a 5-day long signalling poll on PoH Snapshot page about the proposal outcome (that contains the proposal text as well as a link to the HIP post on the PoH Forum), and it must include the option Make no changes. The Phase 2 proposal poll on Snapshot **should be prefixed by [Signalling]** to differentiate them from binding Phase 3 proposal votes*. In order to be eligible to signal in the poll, community members must be registered in the PoH registry.\n\n>   *In the near future, if we are able to create polls on the forum only open to Discourse accounts linked to a PoH profile, then the signalling poll could be done on the forum.\n\n**Duration:** 3 days\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 2 to Phase 3, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes on the forum poll. If the relative majority of votes on the forum poll indicates the result Make no changes, the proposal will not pass to Phase 3.\n\n# Phase 3: Consensus\n\nThis phase opens proposals to two signalling methods for token holders. You can move a proposal to Phase 3 by editing the HIP post from the previous phase to reflect the snapshot signalling poll result that received a relative majority of votes and by updating the proposal’s tag to phase-3. This serves to refine the proposal for the final phase.\n\nAdditionally, a PoH DAO proposal on Snapshot page must be created (that contains the proposal text as well as a link to the HIP post on the PoH Forum), **it should be prefixed by [Binding]** and it must include the option Make no changes. In order to be eligible to vote for the proposal, community members must be registered in the PoH registry.\n\n**Duration:** 7 days\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to be accepted in this final phase, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes in the Snapshot proposal. If the relative majority of votes on the proposal indicates the result Make no changes, the proposal will not be accepted and considered closed.\n\nAny snapshot proposal not following these guidelines can be considered non-binding.\n\nMany thanks to teams in the ecosystem including Gnosis, Balancer and Uniswap, which inspired this governance process.\n\n# HIP Template\n\n    HIP: <Number to be assigned>\n    title: <HIP title>\n    author: <a list of the author's or authors' name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s),\n    status: Draft\n    created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>\n    requires (*optional): <HIP number(s)>\n    replaces (*optional): <HIP number(s)>\n\n### Simple Summary\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nIf you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough. Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the HIP.\n\n### Abstract\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nA short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.\n\n### Motivation\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nThe motivation is critical for HIPs that want to allocate funding or change the PoH DAO. HIP posts without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.\n\n### Specification\n\n(Required for Phase 2)\n\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for it to be reasoned about by participants in the PoH DAO.\n\n### Rationale\n\n(Recommended for Phase 2)\n\nThe rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.\n\n### Implementation\n\n(If necessary, recommended for Phase 3)",

Candidates submits an initial proposal which contains:\n\n* A resume.\n* A brief writing explaining why they would like to work for the DAO and why they think they would be a great fit.\n* The % of their working time they propose to allocate to the DAO, the requested compensation and its yearly equivalent full time. Ex: 50% for 6 months for a total pay of 25k$ (100k$ of yearly equivalent full time).\n\n2. Candidates have a first interview with volunteers among people already working for the DAO (directly or indirectly).\n3. Volunteers ask candidates to complete one recruiting exercise.\n4. Volunteers indicate privately to the candidate the recommendation they would give to the DAO about the candidate (strong reject, weak reject, neutral, weak accept or strong accept). Candidates can then either allow those to become public or withdraw their application. They also have the possibility to readjust the requested compensation.\n5. Volunteers make those recommendation public.\n6. A recruitment proposal is put to vote.\n\nOnce a worker proposal is accepted, it’s paid monthly for all its duration. In case of under-performance, or budget restriction, the DAO can terminate contracts with a 2 week notice which starts counting from the end of the vote.\nWorkers can stop working within the same notice period but it is advised that they inform the DAO ahead of time and work to find a suitable replacement.\nThe DAO doesn’t monitor worker time, it only cares about productivity and assumes that an equivalent full-time is made of 226 days of work (365 days per year - 2*52 for weekends - 35 for holidays).",

        "body": "Forum discussion: https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-1-ubi-accrual-rate-based-on-vouching-activity/128\n\nThe accrual rate of UBI can be connected to the activity aimed at growing the Proof of Humanity network. Users that are spending gas to vouch for other humans, will be rewarded with more UBI than those that are not contributing to the growth of Proof of Humanity.\n\nTaking into consideration that the current accrual rate is `0.00028 UBI per second` (or `1.00 UBI per hour`), users will be able to earn the full rate if they vouch for at least one human in Proof of Humanity. If a user has never vouched for someone, she can still accrue UBI but at a fraction of the full accrual rate. We suggest to lower the accrual to 1/10th the rate (ie. `0.10 UBI per hour`).\n\n# Development\n\nThe UBI token contract will be upgraded with a new interface to Proof of Humanity that will have the ability to call `getSubmissionInfo` and obtain for a given address if it has vouched or not for someone else using the `hasVouched` boolean value returned by Proof of Humanity. \n\n```\ninterface IProofOfHumanity {\n  function isRegistered(address _submissionID)\n    external\n    view\n    returns (\n      bool registered\n    );\n   function getSubmissionInfo(address _submissionID)\n     external\n     view\n     returns (\n       bool status,\n       uint submissionTime, \n       uint index, \n       bool registered, \n       bool hasVouched, // value used for accrual rate\n       uint numberOfRequests\n     )\n}\n```\n\nThe `getAccruedValue` function  that is called by `balanceOf` will then take into consideration if a given address has vouched or not and set the accrual rate based on this data.\n\n# Considerations\n\nThis will mitigate inflation of the UBI token during its initial phase and reward participants in the network that are effectively contributing to its growth.\n\nUsers that have accrued UBI before this modification will have to transfer their funds to a new address to keep their accrued UBI, or else their accrued UBI so far will be impacted by the new formula if they haven't vouched for anyone yet.\n",
