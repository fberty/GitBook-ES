# The principle of allowing parents and carers to support submission
It is currently not possible for young children who cannot speak or follow instructions to receive $ubi. It is also not possible for people with certain voice-related disabilities to receive $ubi. We need to establish a development principle that parents and carers can be involved in the proof of humanity process to ensure that $ubi is available to all. Whilst it may require significant challenges to be overcome there must be an underlying principle set by the community to come together to solve those challenges.
