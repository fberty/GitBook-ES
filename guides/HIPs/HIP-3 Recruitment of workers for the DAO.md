# HIP-3 Recruitment of workers for the DAO
Forum discussion: https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-recruitment-of-workers-for-the-dao/174

# Introduction

For its development, the DAO needs people working on it. The two main priorities would be a project manager and a developer.

# Proposal

We propose that the DAO opens two positions: 1 “project manager” (in charge of increasing integrations, community management, etc.) and 1 developer (to fix bugs, add new features to PoH, help with integrations, etc). The positions will be paid partially in ETH (labelled in USD), partially in UBI (labelled in UBI).

This proposal doesn’t directly engage the DAO but signals that it will consider applicants.

# Justification

In order to expand, the DAO needs workers.
