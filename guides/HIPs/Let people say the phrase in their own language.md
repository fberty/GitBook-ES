# Let people say the phrase in their own language
According to the principle of humanity, what we need to prove is that we are humans, for that, we need a vouch from someone we know, i.e a friend, a relative, therefore we can agree that the voucher and vouchee speaks the same language and can validate what is saying.  
This change can make more people, that are afraid of saying the phrase in english because they are embarrassed of their pronunciation or because the do not know how to sait be feel more includeed by this beautiful community that we are creating.
