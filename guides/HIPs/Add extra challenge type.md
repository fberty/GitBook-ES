# Add extra challenge type
(Inspiration from https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-on-identity-theft/703  and “Primary Document > Challenge Types > Deceased”).

Considering the rising (potential) issue with identify theft, I suggest the following:

Add another challenge type, e.g., “Suspicious.”

The challenger is willing to risk his/her ETH to verify the person is attached to the ETH address.

Add this to the challenge types:

Suspicious: It is expected that the submitter is not the owner of the ETH address.

The challenged submitter can provide a video of him/herself reading a recent block hash. Submitters not able to give recent proof are to be considered the wrongful owner of the ETH address.
