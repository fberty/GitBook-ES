# HIP-19 [Binding]: Code of Conduct for PoH Telegram channels.md
**Introduction**

I’ve been observing that conversations on the Proof of Humanity telegram channels are sometimes taken over by groups using toxic memes and super heavy language like “poorfag” and “retard”.

Not only this makes many, me included, feel alienated from these spaces, but it is detrimental to our ability to have productive debates and collaborate as a community.

Here’s a minimal Code of Conduct which i think could be helpful for us to have on the Proof of Humanity telegram channels. This final version is the result of integrating all of the comments and critiques made by the community in this thread. Thank you all for your contributions, especially:

It also adapted sections from the Citizen Code of Conduct and the RadicalxChange Community Code of Conduct. 

**Here it is:**

* Proof of Humanity is committed to the principle of openness, and facilitating a free exchange of ideas in an environment of thoughtful discourse.

* Proof of Humanity is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.

* The following behaviors will lead you to being banned from the channel:

Threats of violence or violent language.

Sexually explicit material or language.

Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.

Personal insults.

Spamming, trolling, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

Impersonating another person by copying their avatar, posting content under their email address, intentionally using a deceptively similar username or otherwise posing as someone else.

Doxxing and invasion of privacy: posting other people’s personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject’s consent, may be considered to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject.

--
**Channel admins will be responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct, according to these rules:**

* If they consider a transgression to be less severe they may choose to give an initial warning instead of a ban.

* If a user has already received a 24 hour ban and disrespects the Code of Conduct once again, they shall be permanently banned.
